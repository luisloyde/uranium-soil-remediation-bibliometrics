	abstract = {In the process of electrokinetic (EK) remediation of uranium-contaminated soil, the existence form of uranium in soil pore fluid will affect on its migration behavior. In this paper, a novel type of electrolyte (citric acid + ferric chloride, CA+ FeCl3) has been investigated for the EK remediation of uranium-contaminated red soil. The effects of different electrolyte and the concentrations of FeCl3 on migration behavior of U(VI) and environmental risks were investigated after EK remediation. The result showed that the optimum concentration was 0.1 mol/L CA mixed with 0.03 mol/L FeCl3 in this study. At this time, the removal efficiency of uranium was about 61.55 ± 0.41%, and the cumulative energy consumption was 0.2559 kWh. Compared with deionized water and single CA, combined CA with FeCl3 has the advantages of high removal efficiency, low leaching toxicity, and less damage to the soil after the electrokinetic remediation treatment. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Two experimental plots consisting of an alkaline soil heavily contaminated with radionuclides (mainly U and Ra) and non-ferrous metals (mainly Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb) were treated in situ under real field conditions using the activity of the indigenous soil microflora. This activity was enhanced by suitable changes in the levels of some essential environmental factors such as pH and water, oxygen and nutrient contents of the soil. The treatment was connected with solubilization and removal of contaminants from the top soil layer (horizon A) due to the joint action of the soil microorganisms (mainly various heterotrophs) and leach solutions used to irrigate the soil (water solutions of bicarbonate and soluble organics). In one of the plots the dissolved contaminants were removed from the soil profile through the drainage soil effluents. In the other plot the dissolved contaminants were transferred to the deeply located soil subhorizon B2 where they were precipitated as the relevant insoluble forms (uranium as uraninite, and the non-ferrous metals as the relevant sulphides) as a result of the activity of the sulfate-reducing bacteria inhabiting this soil subhorizon. This activity was enhanced by injecting water solutions of acetate, lactate, ammonium and phosphate ions to this soil subhorizon. © (2010) by the Australasian Institute for Mining and Metallurgy (AusIMM).},

The development of nuclear science and technology has led to increasing nuclear waste containing uranium being released and disposed in the environment. The objective of this paper is to develop a better understanding of the techniques for the remediation of soils polluted with radionuclides (uranium in particular), considering: the chemical forms of uranium, including depleted uranium (DU) in soil and other environmental media, their characteristics and concentrations, and some of the effects on environmental and human health; research issues concerning the remediation process, the benefits and results; a better understanding of the range of uses and situations for which each is most appropriate. The paper addresses the main features of the following techniques for uranium remediation: natural attenuation, physical methods, chemical processes (chemical extraction methods from contaminated soils assisted by various suitable chelators (sodium bicarbonate, citric acid, two-stage acid leaching procedure), extraction using supercritical fluids such as solvents, permeable reactive barriers), biological processes (biomineralization and microbial reduction, phytoremediation, biosorption), and electrokinetic methods. In addition, factors affecting uranium removal from soils are furthermore reviewed including soil characteristics, pH and reagent concentration, retention time. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigated the effects of biochar application with different pyrolysis temperatures (300 ℃, 500 ℃ and 700 ℃) on remediation of uranium-stressed soil. The results showed that higher pyrolysis temperature (700 ℃) was benefit for ryegrass growing and caused a lower uranium accumulation in plants. At the same time, uranium immobilization was more effective at higher biochar pyrolysis temperature. Careful investigations indicated that activities of soil urease and sucrase were promoted, and bacterial diversity was strengthened in C700 group, which may contribute to uranium immobilization. The biochar application could activate metabolic of lipids and amino acids, organic acids and derivatives, and organic oxygen compounds. Nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, and Benzoxazinoid biosynthesis were unique metabolic pathways in the C700 group, which could enhance the uranium tolerance from different perspectives. Based on these results, we recommend to use biochar with 700 °C pyrolysis temperature when processing remediation of uranium-stressed soil. This study will facilitate the implementation of biochar screening and provide theoretical helps for remediation of uranium-stressed soil. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Soil contamination by uranium presents a burgeoning global environmental concern, exerting detrimental effects on both agricultural production and soil health. Biochar, a carbonaceous material derived from biomass pyrolysis, exhibits considerable potential for remediating uranium-contaminated soils. However, a comprehensive review of the effects of biochar on the fate and accumulation of uranium in soil–plant systems remains conspicuously absent. In this paper, uranium sources and contamination are reviewed, and the impact of biochar on uranium immobilization and detoxification in soil–plant systems is analyzed. We reviewed the status of uranium contamination in soils globally and found that mining activities are currently the main sources. Further meta-analysis revealed that biochar addition significantly reduced the soil uranium bioavailability and shoot uranium accumulation, and their effect value is 58.9% (40.8–76.8%) and 39.7% (15.7–63.8%), respectively. Additionally, biochar enhances the soil microenvironment, providing favourable conditions for promoting plant growth and reducing uranium mobility. We focused on the mechanisms governing the interaction between biochar and uranium, emphasising the considerable roles played by surface complexation, reduction, ion exchange, and physical adsorption. The modification of biochar by intensifying these mechanisms can promote uranium immobilisation in soils. Finally, biochar alleviates oxidative stress and reduces uranium accumulation in plant tissues, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of uranium on plant growth and development. Overall, our review highlights the capacity of biochar to remediate uranium contamination in soil–plant systems through diverse mechanisms, providing valuable insights for sustainable environmental remediation. Highlights Biochar reduces uranium mobility through a variety of mechanisms, including surface complexation, reduction, ion exchange, and physical adsorption. Biochar significantly reduces uranium bioavailability in soil and limits its accumulation in plants. Modified biochar has been shown to enhance its effectiveness in immobilising uranium. Biochar application to soil not only promotes uranium remediation but also improves soil quality. Graphical Abstract: (Figure presented.) © The Author(s) 2024.},

A-2 (A-2) fungi on the biomass, uranium (U) enrichment and enzyme activity of Macleaya cordata (P), as well as the organic acid content, bioavailable uranium and microbial community structure in the rhizosphere soil. The results showed that compared with AC+P+U, A-2+P+U, and P+U groups, the fresh weight, plant height and total dry weight of Macleaya cordata in AC+A-2+P+U group were significantly increased by 10.67%~45.76%, 26.87%~92.02% and 61.99%~159.98%, respectively, and the contents of the total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and catalase (CAT) were increased by 41.24%~133% and 15.35%~63.63%, respectively, and the oxalic acid was increased by 13.03%~157.09%. Compared with the A-2+P+U and P+U groups, the bioavailable uranium in soil in AC+A-2+P+U group was increased by 12.5% and 28.57%, respectively. In the AC+A-2+P+U groups, there were a large number of Fusarium fungi and Acidobacteria in rhizosphere soil, and the proportion of Fusarium fungi was the highest. Compared with AC+P+U, A-2+P+U, P+U, and A-2+U groups, the proportion of Fusarium fungi in AC+A-2+P+U group was increased by 16.67%, 81.03%, 299.23% and 374.47%, respectively. The mechanisms of AC and A-2 coupling enhanced the remediation of uranium contaminated soil by Macleaya cordata may be include that AC improved the mobility of uranium in soil, increased the contact between plant roots and uranium, and promoted the enrichment of uranium by Macleaya cordata; that AC stimulated the physiological activity and increased the biomass of Macleaya cordata, improved the activity of antioxidant enzymes, and enhanced the tolerance of Macleaya cordata to uranium; and that AC stimulated the growth of A-2 fungi and Acidobacteria, increased their proportion, and produced a large number of organic acids which can form chelates with uranium, reduced the stress of uranium on plants, increased the proportion of bioavailable speciation of uranium, and promoted the enrichment of uranium by Macleaya cordata. AC and A-2 coupling exhibited a significant enhancement effect on the remediation of uranium contaminated soil by Macleaya cordata, and there coupling was a promising enhancement method. © 2022, Editorial Board of China Environmental Science.

	abstract = {The old Senhora das Fontes uranium mine, located in central Portugal, was closed down in 1971. The treatment of ores from this mine and other mines by heap-leach ended in 1982. Seven dumps partially covered by vegetation were left in the area. Soil and stream sediment samples were collected in December 2009. The remediation was carried out from May 2010 to January 2011. Stream sediment samples were collected again in October 2013. Before the remediation, soils from inside the mine influence area have higher Al, As, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Sr, Th, U and Zn concentrations than soils from outside this area, due to radionuclides, metals and metalloid released from the mine dumps. The principal component analysis (PCA) shows a distinction between soils from inside and outside the mine influence area. The U(VI), As(V) and metals from soils can be adsorbed to Fe-oxyhydroxides and the humic acid can increase the U uptake. Soils must not be used for public or private green and residential areas, because they are contaminated in U, As, Co, Cd and Ni. Before the remediation, downstream sediments have higher Al, As, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, U and Zn than upstream sediments, due to erosion and percolation of water through the mine dumps. The PCA shows a distinction between downstream and upstream sediments. The U(VI), Th and As(V) can be adsorbed to Fe-oxyhydroxides. The stream sediments are contaminated in As, Mn, Th and U. Downstream sediments are the most contaminated in U and As. After the remediation, upstream and downstream sediments have generally higher Al, Fe, As, Cr, Ni, Th, U and Zn concentrations than before the remediation, attributed to the relocation of dumps. Radionuclides, metals and metalloids were transported by surface water. Consequently downstream sediments have higher Al, As, Cu, Mn, Ni, Th, U and Zn concentrations than upstream sediments. The U(VI), Th and As(V) can be adsorbed to Fe-oxyhydroxides. Stream sediments became more contaminated in U, Th and As than before the remediation, but more intensively downstream. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Uranium production induces contamination of natural objects, in particular, soils in in-situ uranium leaching areas. Radionuclides of the uranium decay chains, such as U238, U234, U235, Th230, Ra226 etc., in soil in in-situ uranium leaching areas impose risk and hazard on mine personnel and on nature. The content of radionuclides in contaminated soil is determined in order to prevent the adverse effect of their radiation. With the known content and specific activity of radionuclides in soil, the soil remediation methods are identified, including machinery, technology and leaching techniques. This article presents the sequence of remediation and the operating principle of the new flowchart. The portability and low costs of the flowchart are demonstrated. In contaminated soil under analysis, the content of general uranium ranges from 0.00293 to 0.00513%. After treatment of contaminated soil using the proposed method, the content of uranium decreases and becomes 0.00145 to 0.00255%. The proposed method of remediation of soil contaminated with the uranium decoy chain radionuclides is assumed to be suitable for the application on a large scale. © 2021 Publishing house Mining book.

	abstract = {Seepage of uranium tailings has become a focus of attention in the uranium mining and metallurgy industry, and in-situ microbial remediation is considered an effective way to treat uranium pollution. However, this method has the drawbacks of easy biomass loss and unstable remediation effect. To overcome these issues, spare red soil around the uranium mine was used to enhance the efficiency and stability of bioremediation. Furthermore, the bioremediation mechanism was revealed by employing XRD, FTIR, XPS, and 16S rRNA. The results showed that red soil, as a barrier material, had the adsorption potential of 8.21–148.00 mg U/kg soil, but the adsorption is accompanied by the release of certain acidic and oxidative substances. During the dynamic microbial remediation, red soil was used as a cover material to neutralize acidity, provide a higher reduction potential (<-200 mV), and increase the retention rate of microbial agent (19.06 mL/d) compared to the remediation group without red soil. In the presence of red soil, the anaerobic system could maintain the uranium concentration in the solution below 0.3 mg/L for more than 70 days. Moreover, the generation of new clay minerals driven by microorganisms was more conducive to the stability of uranium tailings. Through alcohol and amino acid metabolism of microorganisms, a reducing environment with reduced valence states of multiple elements (such as S2−, Fe2+, and U4+) was formed. At the same time, the relative abundance of functional microbial communities in uranium tailings improved in presence of red soil and Desulfovirobo, Desulfocapsa, Desulfosporosinus, and other active microbial communities reconstructed the anaerobic environment. The study provides a new two-in-one solution for treatment of uranium tailings and resource utilization of red soil through in-situ microbial remediation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

In the first step, the contaminated soil is separated from the clean soil using the Thermo Nuclean (a division of the Thermo NUtech company) Segmented Gate System (SGS). Contaminated soil proceeds via conveyor belt to a separate storage bin to await further processing, while uncontaminated soil is returned to its original location. From the 218 cubic yards of soil excavated from the test site at TA-33, only seven cubic yards were found to contain uranium contamination above the criterion release limit, yielding an initial waste volume reduction of 97 percent. Using the containerized vat leaching (CVL) method, a technique borrowed from the mining industry, the uranium was then removed from the reduced volume of contaminated soil.

Owing to these problems, remediation of uranium-contaminated soils has been investigated by various techniques. This review focuses on the challenges and complexities associated with the remediation of uranium-contaminated soil at field level. Therefore, laboratory studies have been excluded from this review. Challenges faced during remediation of uranium-contaminated soil using various techniques such as microbial/phyto/chemical/material based strategies have been discussed with suitable examples. Various factors that have a major influence on uranium decontamination process in soil such as soil type, uranium speciation, the presence of coexisting ions and organics, etc., have been highlighted.

There is an urgent need for remediation of this contamination in order to prevent its possible long-term effects not only on the population in the contaminated regions but also on the neighboring countries. Therefore, it is necessary that together with permanent monitoring of environmental contamination, we proceed with research and development on selection of cost effective remediation technology appropriate for large areas such as contaminated water and soil. Conventional remediation techniques: excavation, treatment (soil washing, chelating), conditioning and disposal as low-level radioactive waste are necessary for heavy contaminated sites. However, for a large area of contaminated soil and aquifer sediments in situ remediation is appealing since it is much less disruptive to the ecosystem and hydrology, reduces the risk of worker exposure during remediation and is typically less expensive than conventional technologies. In situ remediation involves minimizing the mobility of contaminants by transferring them to stable, nonlabile phases via chemically induced transformation. © 2017, CI and CEQ. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Controlled experiment, single factor experiment and orthogonal experiment were used to study the electrokinetic optimization of uranium contaminated soil. The uranium removal efficiency increased to 55.73%, with an average leaching toxic concentration of uranium of only 0.07mol/L. After applying a composite electrolyte of 0.20mol/L tartaric acid and 0.05mol/L ferric chloride to the optimized device, the energy utilization efficiency increased to 306.21. Meanwhile, uranium mainly exists in the form of positively charged uranyl ion (UO22+) and a minor amount of neutral uranium-tartrate complex by using Visual MINTEQ software, therefore, due to the synergy of electromigration and forward electrodialysis, the migration direction of uranium is from anode to cathode. Subsequently, the experimental parameters yielding the best removal efficiency in this study were determined to be 0.15mol/L of tartaric acid, 0.08mol/L of ferric chloride, and 1.5V/cm of voltage gradient via orthogonal experiment. In addition, the modified device has the potential to improve the effect of soil remediation by ameliorating soil conductivity, zeta potential and pH levels. Moreover, when utilizing the composite liquid made up of tartaric acid and ferric chloride as the electrolyte in the modified device for repairing soil contaminated with uranium, the energy utilization and removal efficiency were elevated, and the toxicity associated with uranium leaching was substantially reduced. Therefore, an efficient and sustainable in-situ remediation technology for uranium-contaminated soil is provided. © 2023 Chinese Society for Environmental Sciences. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this study, three different electrode materials (graphite, stainless steel, and titanium rods) were used to explore the electro kinetic (EK) remediation of soil contaminated with uranium (U). All EK experiments were carried out in a soil cell reactor with a moisture content of 25.1% and a total uranium mixture of 90.6 mg/kg at a constant voltage gradient (1V/cm) for 5 days. The experimental results show that the EK repair process with graphite rod as the electrode material has the highest current peak, and the overall current level is higher than the other two electrode materials. Compared with stainless steel and titanium rods, the removal efficiency of using graphite as the electrode material U in contaminated soil reached 34.11%. However, the removal rates using stainless steel and titanium rods were lower, 15.79% and 18.77%, respectively. In the EK experiment, the main removal is from the exchangeable part of U to the carbon-bound U composition, while the remaining forms of uranium are difficult to remove under this condition, so in order to be more efficient, the uranium in the soil is removed with maximum reduction. It is necessary to use it in conjunction with other enhancement technologies. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The pollution of soils and waters by radionuclides and toxic heavy metals is a serious environmental problem in many countries, especially in those with intensive industrial development and/or with a large-scale recovery of such elements from the relevant mineral deposits. The pollution is due to different mechanisms, some of which are acting under natural conditions but others are directly connected with the human activity. In some cases, this activity is connected with the recovery of valuable components from the relevant natural sources, mainly the ore deposits, but in some cases the recovery is connected with the processing of some mineral wastes or even of industrial products such as metal-bearing concentrates. Since a relatively long period of time, some of these technologies have been connected with the application of different microorganisms which are able to solubilize or to precipitate the relevant metals under suitable conditions. Apart from the recovery of different metals, some microorganisms are used to prevent pollution or even to participate in the cleaning of ecosystems polluted by toxic elements. © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

However, after soil washing, with a sulfuric acid solution and an oxidant at 65 °C, the removal of the muddy solution using a 100 mesh sieve can decrease the radioactivity of the remaining coarse soil to the clearance level. Therefore, only a small amount of fine soil collected from the muddy solution requires the electrokinetic process for its decontamination. Furthermore, it is found that the selective removal of uranium from the sulfuric washing solution is not obtained using an anion exchanger but rather using a cation exchanger, unexpectedly. More than 90% of the uranium in the soil washing solutions is adsorbed on the S-950 resin, and 87% of the uranium adsorbed on S-950 is desorbed by washing with a 0.5 M Na2CO3 solution at 60 °C. © 2016},

	abstract = {The addition of soil amendments to facilitate plant-based remediation of soil contaminated with radioactive nuclides is considered a promising approach. Here, we tested different levels of biochar to help clean uranium-contaminated soil in the potted plants. Adding 1% biochar had the best results in deactivating uranium, increasing soil enzyme activity, and promoting ryegrass growth. Microbiological and metabolomic analysis further revealed that 1 wt % biochar significantly enhanced the abundance of microorganisms such as Actinobacteriota and Myxococcota and accelerated the production of differential metabolites such as lipids and lipid-like molecules, organic acids and derivatives, and organic oxygen compounds. The analysis of biological and nonbiological interaction networks indicates that the coordinated interaction between bacteria, enzymes, and metabolites significantly improves the expression level of the ABC transporter’s metabolic pathway. This enhances the resistance of living cells to uranium and maintains system homeostasis under uranium stress. This study provides an example of the application of biochar-assisted phytoremediation and offers theoretical guidance for the remediation of soil contaminated with radioactive nuclides. © 2024 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {In alkaline soil, abundant carbonates will mobilize uranium (U) and increase its ecotoxicity, which is a serious threat to crop growth. However, the knowledge of U remediation in alkaline soils remains very limited. In this study, U-contaminated alkaline soil (tillage layer) was collected from the Ili mining area of Xinjiang, the soil remediation was carried out by using phosphorus (P) fertilizers of different solubility (including KH2PO4, Ca(H2PO4)2, CaHPO4, and Ca3(PO4)2), and the pathways and mechanisms of U passivation in the alkaline soil were revealed. The results showed that water-soluble P fertilizers, KH2PO4 and Ca(H2PO4)2, were highly effective at immobilizing U, and significantly reduced the bioavailability of soil U. The exchangeable U was reduced by 70.5 ± 0.1% (KH2PO4) and 68.2 ± 1.9% (Ca(H2PO4)2), which was converted into the Fe–Mn oxide-bound and residual phases. Pot experiments showed that soil remediation by KH2PO4 significantly promoted crop growth, especially for roots, and reduced U uptake in crops by 94.5 ± 1.0%. The immobilization of U by KH2PO4 could be attributed to the release of phosphate anions, which react with the uranyl ion (UO22+) forming a stable mineral of meta-ankoleite and enhancing the binding of UO22+ to the soil Fe–Mn oxides. In addition, KH2PO4 dissolution produces acidity and P fertilizer, which can reduce soil alkalinity and improve crop growth. The findings in this work demonstrate that a rational application of P fertilizer can effectively, conveniently, and cheaply remediate U contamination and improve crop yield and safety on alkaline farmland. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

Due to the special particularities of uranium and the complexity of components in soil, how to remedy U-contaminated soils becomes an interesting problem in recent years. On the basis of present the domestic and foreign researches, this paper reviews the uranium speciation characteristics in soils, the concept of phytoremediation and electrokinetic remediation, current international research. Restricting factors, advantages and limitations, and the future trends, complementary were discussed too. Phytoremediation is fit for large-scale and low-level uranium contaminated soils, while electrokinetic remediation can be used for higher uranium concentration, bad environment and deep uranium contaminated soils. Combining phytoremediation and electrokinetic remediation is good for remediation of soil contaminated with uranium. The combination of the two technologies may bring some hopes to solve this problem.},

	abstract = {Uranium in its natural state is composed of three distinct isotopes: 238, 235, and 234U. This heavy metal has a substantial level of chemical toxicity for biota. It transports radioactivity from the earth into the indoor environment, raising the risk of lung cancer. Its uptake by plants can result in cellular damage and disruption of cellular homeostasis and its regulation. The pH of the environment and the presence of complex ligands are two factors that affect the chemical speciation of uranium in the environment. This chemical speciation determines the destiny, transportation, bioavailability, and dangerous potential of uranium. Both bioavailability and toxicity are extremely sensitive to how an individual is exposed to them.

	abstract = {Uranium(U), a highly toxic radionuclide, is becoming a great threat to soil health development, as returning nuclear waste containing U into the soil systems is increased. Numerous studies have focused on: i) tracing the source in U contaminated soils; ii) exploring U geochemistry; and iii) assessing U phyto-uptake and its toxicity to plants. Yet, there are few literature reviews that systematically summarized the U in soil-plant system in past decade. Thus, we present its source, geochemical behavior, uptake, toxicity, detoxification, and bioremediation strategies based on available data, especially published from 2018 to 2021. In this review, we examine processes that can lead to the soil U contamination, indicating that mining activities are currently the main sources. We discuss the relationship between U bioavailability in the soil-plant system and soil conditions including redox potential, soil pH, organic matter, and microorganisms. We then review the soil-plant transfer of U, finding that U mainly accumulates in roots with a quite limited translocation. However, plants such as willow, water lily, and sesban are reported to translocate high U levels from roots to aerial parts. Indeed, U does not possess any identified biological role, but provokes numerous deleterious effects such as reducing seed germination, inhibiting plant growth, depressing photosynthesis, interfering with nutrient uptake, as well as oxidative damage and genotoxicity. Yet, plants tolerate U toxicity via various defense strategies including antioxidant enzymes, compartmentalization, and phytochelatin. Moreover, we review two biological remediation strategies for U-contaminated soil: (i) phytoremediation and (ii) microbial remediation. They are quite low-cost and eco-friendly compared with traditional physical or chemical remediation technologies. Finally, we conclude some promising research challenges regarding U biogeochemical behavior in soil-plant systems. This review, thus, further indicates that the combined application of U low accumulators and microbial inoculants may be an effective strategy for the bioremediation of U-contaminated soils. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Increasing uranium (U) content in soils due to anthropogenic U contamination causes accumulation of U in plants, which greatly increases human health risks. This review identified the diverse sources of soil U contamination and their significant spatial variations in surface soils globally based on 789 soil sampling sites collected from 76 studies. The relationships between U biogeochemical transformation and its bioavailability in soil are significantly affected by soil redox potential, pH, metal (hydr)oxides, organic matter, and microorganisms. The toxicity/detoxification mechanisms of U in plants and microorganisms have been extensively studied, and further studies should combine with omics techniques (proteomics, genomics, and metabolomics) to narrow the knowledge gaps in molecular mechanisms. Moreover, the mechanisms and applicability of phytoremediation and microbial bioremediation in U-contaminated soils were summarized. Based on the present review, we further propose several critical challenges and directions for improving our knowledge and remediation strategies of U contamination in the soil-plant system. This review would help us better understand the geochemical behavior of U in soil-plant systems and its potential risks to human health. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Optimum experiment conditions for mixing ratios of penatron and soil, and the pH of soil was obtained through several bioremediations with soil contaminated with uranium and radium. It was found that an optimum mixing ratio of penatron for bioremediation of uranium soil was 1 %. Also, the optimum pH condition for bioremediation of soil contaminated with uranium and radium was 7.5. The removal efficiencies of uranium and radium from higher concentration of soil were rather reduced in comparison with those from lower concentration of soil. Meanwhile, the removal of uranium and radium in concrete by bioremediation is possible but the removal rate from concrete was slower than that from soil. The removal efficiencies of uranium and radium from soil under injection of 1 % penatron at pH 7.5 for 120 days were 81.2 and 81.6 %, respectively, and the removal efficiencies of uranium and radium from concrete under the same condition were 63.0 and 45.2 %, respectively.

This study reports the development of a chemical extraction methodology for remediation of soils contaminated with particulate DU. Uranium phases in soils from two sites at a UK firing range, MOD Eskmeals, were characterised by electron microscopy and sequential extraction. Uranium rich particles with characteristic spherical morphologies were observed in soils, consistent with other instances of DU munitions contamination. Batch extraction efficiencies for aqueous ammonium bicarbonate (42-50% total DU extracted), citric acid (30-42% total DU) and sulphuric acid (13-19% total DU) were evaluated. Characterisation of residues from bicarbonate-treated soils by synchrotron microfocus X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed partially leached U(IV)-oxide particles and some secondary uranyl-carbonate phases. Based on these data, a multi-stage extraction scheme was developed utilising leaching in ammonium bicarbonate followed by citric acid to dissolve secondary carbonate species. Site specific U extraction was improved to 68-87% total U by the application of this methodology, potentially providing a route to efficient DU decontamination using low cost, environmentally compatible reagents. © 2013 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Wyoming is the largest producer of uranium in the United States. An increase in exploration and extraction comes with renewed interest in nuclear power. Associated is a need to be prepared for handling radionuclidecontaminated soils from leaks and surface spills during in-situ recovery (ISR) of uranium. Uranium mining is controversial in the United States. Consideration of methods for remediating contaminated soils is warranted for economic, environmental, and public health reasons. While uranium is removed in the mining process, radium contamination is of concern when leaks or spills occur. Research exists on treatment strategies for radium in soils, including physical, biological and chemical methods. Commonly, contaminated soils are removed and transported off-site for disposal at Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)-approved facilities. This can be quite expensive and involves the added risk of transport of radioactive material along public highways. Having plans in place for otherwise dealing with soils in the event of contamination would be beneficial to industry from economic, regulatory and public relations standpoints. A two-phase study has been designed in which an extensive literature review is conducted of methods used to mitigate radionuclide contamination of soils, particularly that of 226radium (226Ra), and then lab results are used from radiumcontaminated soils specific to a Wyoming mine site to determine a remediation strategy for implementation. Feasibility of strategies are analyzed in relation to soil and vegetation characteristics typical of Wyoming uranium mine lands, so that operators will have access to this information when deciding the best course of action for handling radionuclide-contaminated soils. Preliminary results of the first stage of this project show a dearth of studies on radium in soils, but that some physical, biological and chemical methods have been used and may warrant further consideration.},

	abstract = {Uranium (U) in the U-contaminated acidic red soil exhibits high mobility. In the present study, rice husk was used to produce biochar to remediate U-contaminated red soil under acid precipitation. Firstly, batch adsorption experiments showed that the dissolution of alkaline substance in biochar could buffer the pH value of acidic solution. The equilibrium pH value had a crucial influence on biochar adsorption capacity of U, and the neutral equilibrium pH value was favorable for adsorption. Then, the incubation experiments of red soil with biochar were performed, and the Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure (SPLP) extraction of amended red soil showed that the short-term leachability of U was decreased from 26.53% in control group (without biochar) to 1.40% in 10% biochar-amended red soil. Subsequently, the sequential extraction showed that the fraction of U was mainly transformed from exchangeable and Fe/Mn oxide fraction to carbonate fraction after biochar amendment, and the total amount of exchangeable U and carbonate fraction U in soil was increased slightly. Finally, simulated acid rain leaching experiments showed that the capability of amended red soil to resist acid rain acidification was enhanced. And the long-term leachability of U in amended red soil was decreased from 26.37% in control group to 3.18% in the 10% biochar-amended red soil under the simulated acid rain leaching conditions. In conclusion, biochar has passivation effect on U in U-contaminated red soil, which can reduce the long-term and short-term mobility of U in acidic environments.

	abstract = {To solve the problem of soil environmental pollution resulting from uranium mine development and production, a soil slurry reactor was used to evaluate the use of chemical leaching to remediate uranium-contaminated soils and to analyze possible uranium removal mechanisms through laboratory-scale trials and pilot-scale trials. A laboratory-scale trial comparing different reagents and operating methods revealed that the removal of total uranium from contaminated soil could reach 91.18% under optimal conditions when FeCl3, OA, NaClO2, and HEDP were used as eluents. Based on the optimal ratio and operating conditions determined from laboratory-scale trials, a pilot-scale trial was conducted around a uranium mining area: soil leaching remediation was conducted in two 3 m3 soil-slurry reactors to verify the practicality of the leaching technology and examine the functionality of the remediated soil. The experimental results showed that the rate of uranium removal from contaminated soil by the chemical leaching method was greater than 80%. FTIR, XRF and enzyme activity analysis proved that remediation restored the original soil function and reduced the ecological risk, indicating that the chemical leaching technology was environmentally friendly and economical. These findings provide insight to guide the future assessment and remediation practices of uranium-contaminated sites. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Uranium (U) pollution in soils is prevalent worldwide and poses a significant health risk that will require remediation approaches. However, traditional U bioreduction by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) are sensitive to oxygen and are not suitable for treating aerobic topsoil. Bioprecipitation of U into uranyl phosphate (U–P) mediated by phosphate-solubilizing microorganism (PSM) is not affected by oxygen. In this study, PSM strains were isolated and used for U-contaminated soil remediation. Microbial metabolites and the mechanism of PSM bioprecipitation were revealed. The results showed that strain Enterobacter sp. N1-10 had the highest phosphate-solubilizing capacity (dissolved P was 409.51 ± 8.48 mg/L). Uranium bioprecipitation was investigated by culturing the bacterium in the presence of 50 mg/L U and in the cell-free culture supernatant. The results showed that strain N1–10 had a high U removal rate (99.45 ± 0.43 %) after adding 50 mg/L U to the culture medium. A yellow precipitate was immediately formed when uranyl nitrate solution was added to the cell-free culture supernatant. The analysis indicated that bacterium produced lactic acid (37.58 mg/L), citric acid (4.76 mg/L), succinic acid (2.03 mg/L), and D-glucuronic acid (1.94 mg/L); the four organic acids solubilized Ca3(PO4)2 to form stable uranyl phosphate precipitate. The application of strain N1-10 and Ca3(PO4)2 significantly decreased the bioavailability of soil U (43.54 ± 0.52 %). In addition, pot experiments showed that PSM N1-10 and Ca3(PO4)2 promoted plant growth and markedly reduced U accumulation by pakchoi. These results demonstrate that PSM N1-10 and Ca3(PO4)2 exhibit a great potential for U bioremediation. © 2023},

	abstract = {Zero-valent iron/activated carbon (ZVI/AC) particles can promote the reduction of U(VI) by micro-electrolysis. Therefore, they can be used to develop materials for permeable reactive barrier (PRB). In this study, citric acid (CA) mixed with ferric chloride (FeCl3) was selected as composite electrolyte, and we investigated the feasibility of electrokinetic (EK) coupled with Fe/C-PRB on the remediation of red soil artificially contaminated with U(VI). Seven EK experiments were conducted to study the effect of the type, location, and amount of PRB media on the removal of U(VI) in soil by the EK-PRB system. The results showed that the ZVI/AC mixture is superior to the single ZVI or AC as the PRB medium. For the EK-PRB system, a moderate increase in the number of PRBs and decrease in the thickness of the PRB in soil chamber can enhanced the removal of U(VI) from the contaminated soil. Under optimized conditions, after the 120 h remediation experiment obtained the maximum removal efficiency (80.58 ± 0.99%) of U(VI). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to study the surface properties of the ZVI/AC mixture before and after the reaction. The results demonstrated that the soluble U(VI) was reduced to the insoluble U(IV) in the ZVI/AC mixture, or adsorption of activated carbon or iron corrosion products regardless of the pH distribution. This work provides a green efficient technology for the recovery of U(VI) from contaminated soil, waste slag or solid waste. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Laboratory bench-scale soil washing (batch) and flushing (column flow) experiments were conducted to determine the efficiency of citric acid as an agent to extract uranium from a synthetically contaminated sandy soil. The results of soil washing and flushing experiments indicate that citric acid is highly effective in removing uranium, and that the extraction efficiency increases with increasing citric acid concentration, especially under slightly acidic to alkaline conditions in systems containing sand coated with secondary minerals (e.g., Fe). The enhanced U(VI) desorption in the presence of citrate may be explained through several processes, including the complexation of U(VI) with citrate and extraction of secondary coatings (e.g., Fe), which results in the liberation of Fe-citrate complexes into solution. In batch washing systems, the presence of 10-3 M citric acid enhances the extraction of uranium 2.8 times greater than water alone for the conditions of the experiment. A comparison of soil washing and flushing shows that the extraction efficiency is higher in bench-scale washing experiments. A removal efficiency of up to 98% was achieved with 10 mL of 10-3 M citric acid in batch systems, whereas it required 4 pore volumes (150 mL) of 0.1 M citric acid to accomplish similar extraction efficiencies in column soil flushing systems.

Bicarbonate (100 mM) extracted 20-94% of the uranium that was extracted with nitric acid. The U(VI)-reducing microorganism, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans reduced the U(VI) to U(IV) in the bicarbonate extracts. In some instances unidentified dissolved extracted components, presumably organics, gave the extract a yellow color and inhibited U(VI) reduction and/or the precipitation of U(IV). Removal of the dissolved yellow material with the addition of hydrogen peroxide alleviated this inhibition. These results demonstrate that bicarbonate extraction of uranium from soil followed by microbial U(VI) reduction might be an effective mechanism for concentrating uranium from some contaminated soils. © 1995 Society for Industrial Microbiology.},
