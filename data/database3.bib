	abstract = {Understanding the speciation of technogenic uranium in natural systems is crucial for estimating U migration and bioavailability and for developing remediation strategies for contaminated territories. Reference EXAFS data of model laboratory-prepared uranium compounds ('standards') are necessary to analyze U-contaminated samples from nuclear legacy sites. To minimize errors associated with measurements on different synchrotrons, it is important not only to compare data obtained on environmentally contaminated samples with the literature but also with 'standards' collected at the same beamline. Before recording the EXAFS spectra, all reference compounds were thoroughly characterized by Raman spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction. The U(VI) local molecular environments in the reference compounds, i.e. uranyl oxyhydroxides, phosphates, carbonates and uranates, were examined using XAFS. Based on the EXAFS fitting results obtained, including the nature of the bonding, interatomic distances and coordination numbers, parameters that are typical for a particular U compound were differentiated. Using data for 'standards', U speciation in the sample of radioactively contaminated soil was determined to be a mixture of U oxyhydroxide and carbonate phases. © 2022 International Union of Crystallography.

	abstract = {This study investigated the biogeochemistry of uranium (U), and the co-occurring elements nickel (Ni) and arsenic (As), in colloids and sediments from two meromictic mine pit lakes that have considerably different depths and geochemistry. In order to characterize the processes controlling metal speciation and cycling in the pits, the distribution and speciation of the elements in colloidal size fractions were analyzed using micro- and ultrafiltration in combination with transmission electron microscopy. Sediment traps collected fresh sediments over the course of one year below the chemocline of the pit lakes and were subsequently analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for morphology and chemical digestions. The most common particles found in the shallower pit consisted of Ca-O and Fe-O colloids, while the particles in the deeper pit were composed of Ca-S-O. Filtration results showed a higher abundance of metals in larger colloidal fractions in aged samples, suggesting that colloids can act as metal accumulators. Sediment traps showed the formation of Fe-O, Fe-S, Al-Si, and Ce-P phases, which were observed to sorb U and Ni. The overall U removal was calculated to be 0.9 g/m2/year in both pits, despite considerably different geochemical conditions between the two, and the maximum removal rates for As (shallow pit) and Ni (deeper pit) were 4.7 g/m2/year and 0.6 g/m2/year, respectively. Bottom sediments were also collected from both pits, and characterized using sequential extractions, SEM, synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy and Laue diffraction techniques. These techniques showed that the stability of metals in the sediment follows the order Ni < U < As. Nickel, found in the exchangeable and acid soluble fractions, could be easily mobilized by changes in aqueous ionic strength and pH. Similarly, pH and redox changes in the water may strongly affect U, due to its dominance in the acid soluble and reducible sediment fractions. U(VI) mineral phases confirmed by spectroscopy and Laue diffraction, such as vandendriesscheite and monazite, which were likely associated with the oxidizable sediment fraction, may increase overall U stability. Arsenic was more strongly bound to the sediments and mostly present in the oxidizable and residual (highly recalcitrant) fractions. The collective results demonstrate the importance of colloidal particles for metal sequestration processes and their potential importance on microbial communities in pit lakes, highlighting the need for improved characterization of colloids in environmental studies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The speciation of U(VI) sorbed to synthetic hydroxyapatite was investigated using a combination of U LIII-edge XAS, synchrotron XRD, batch uptake measurements, and SEM-EDS. The mechanisms of U(VI) removal by apatite were determined in order to evaluate the feasibility of apatitebased in-situ permeable reactive barriers (PRBs). In batch U(VI) uptake experiments with synthetic hydroxyapatite (HA), near complete removal of dissolved uranium (>99.5%) to <0.05 μM was observed over a range of total U(VI) concentrations up to equimolar of the total P in the suspension. XRD and XAS analyses of U(VI)-reacted HA at sorbed concentrations ≤4700 ppm U(VI) suggested that uranium(VI) phosphate, hydroxide, and carbonate solids were not present at these concentrations. Fits to EXAFS spectra indicate the presence of Ca neighbors at 3.81 Å. U-Ca separation, suggesting that U(VI) adsorbs to the HA surfaces as an inner-sphere complex. Uranium(VI) phosphate solid phases were not detected in HA with 4700 ppm sorbed U(VI) by backscatter SEM or EDS, in agreement with the surface complexation process. In contrast, U(VI) speciation in samples that exceeded 7000 ppm sorbed U(VI) included a crystalline uranium(VI) phosphate solid phase, identified as chernikovite by XRD. At these higher concentrations, a secondary, uranium(VI) phosphate solid was detected by SEM-EDS, consistent with chernikovite precipitation. Autunite formation occurred at total U:P molar ratios ≥0.2. Our findings provide a basis for evaluating U(VI) sorption mechanisms by commercially available natural apatites for use in development of PRBs for groundwater U(VI) remediation.},

	abstract = {Phosphogypsum formed from the production of phosphoric acid represents by far the biggest accumulation of gypsum-rich wastes in the world and commonly contains elevated radionuclides, including uranium, as well as other heavy metals and metalloids. Therefore, billions-of-tons of phosphogypsum stockpiled worldwide not only possess serious environmental problems but also represent a potential uranium resource. Gypsum is also a major solid constituent in many other types of radioactive mine tailings, which stems from the common usage of sulfuric acid in extraction processes. Therefore, management and remediation of radioactive mine tailings as well as future beneficiation of uranium from phosphogysum all require detailed knowledge about the nature and behavior of uranium in gypsum. However, little is known about the uptake mechanism or speciation of uranium in gypsum. In this study, synthesis experiments suggest an apparent pH control on the uptake of uranium in gypsum at ambient conditions: increase in U from 16 μg/g at pH = 6.5 to 339 μg/g at pH = 9.5. Uranium L3-edge synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopic analyses of synthetic gypsum show that uranyl (UO2)2+ at the Ca site is the dominant species. The EXAFS fitting results also indicate that uranyl in synthetic gypsum occurs most likely as carbonate complexes and yields an average U-O distance ∼0.25 Å shorter than the average Ca-O distance, signifying a marked local structural distortion. Applications to phosphogypsum from the New Wales phosphoric acid plant (Florida, USA) and uranium mine tailings from the Key Lake mill (Saskatchewan, Canada) show that gypsum is an important carrier of uranium over a wide range of pH and controls the fate of this radionuclide in mine tailings. Also, development of new technologies for recovering U from phosphogypsum in the future must consider lattice-bound uranyl in gypsum. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The remediation of uranium from soils and groundwater at Department of Energy (DOE) sites across the United States represents a major environmental issue, and bioremediation has exhibited great potential as a strategy to immobilize U in the subsurface. The bioreduction of U(VI) to insoluble U(IV) uraninite has been proposed to be an effective bioremediation process in anaerobic conditions. However, high concentrations of nitrate and low pH found in some contaminated areas have been shown to limit the efficiency of microbial reduction of uranium. In the present study, nonreductive uranium biomineralization promoted by microbial phosphatase activity was investigated in anaerobic conditions in the presence of high nitrate and low pH as an alternative approach to the bioreduction of U(VI). A facultative anaerobe, Rahnella sp. Y9602, isolated from soils at DOE's Oak Ridge Field Research Center (ORFRC), was able to respire anaerobically on nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor in the presence of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) as the sole carbon and phosphorus source and hydrolyzed sufficient phosphate to precipitate 95% total uranium after 120 hours in synthetic groundwater at pH 5.5. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy identified the mineral formed as chernikovite, a U(VI) autunite-type mineral. The results of this study suggest that in contaminated subsurfaces, such as at the ORFRC, where high concentrations of nitrate and low pH may limit uranium bioreduction, the biomineralization of U(VI) phosphate minerals may be a more attractive approach for in situ remediation providing that a source of organophosphate is supplied for bioremediation. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

There are many gaps in our understanding of the characteristics and mechanisms of plant radionuclide accumulation, including the importance of symbiotically-associated arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. We first briefly review the evidence that demonstrates the ability of AM fungi to enhance the translocation of238U into plant root tissues, and how fungal association may prevent further mobilization into shoot tissues. We then focus on approaches that should further advance our knowledge of AM fungi–plant radionuclide accumulation. Current research has mostly used artificial cultivation methods and we consider how more ecologically-relevant analysis might be performed. The use of synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence imaging and absorption spectroscopy techniques to understand the mechanisms of radionuclide transfer from soil to plant via AM fungi is evaluated. Without such further knowledge, the behavior and mobilization of radionuclides cannot be accurately modeled and the potential risks cannot be accurately predicted. © 2015 Davies, Cox, Robinson and Pittman.},

	abstract = {Background, aim, and scope: The subsurface at the Oak Ridge Field Research Center represents an extreme and diverse geochemical environment that places different stresses on the endogenous microbial communities, including low pH, elevated nitrate concentrations, and the occurrence of heavy metals and radionuclides, including hexavalent uranium [U(VI)]. The in situ immobilization of U(VI) in the aquifer can be achieved through microbial reduction to relatively insoluble U(IV). However, a high redox potential due to the presence of nitrate and the toxicity of heavy metals will impede this process. Our aim is to test biostimulation of the endogenous microbial communities to improve nitrate reduction and subsequent U(VI) reduction under conditions of elevated heavy metals. Materials and methods: Column experiments were used to test the possibility of using biostimulation via the addition of ethanol as a carbon source to improve nitrate reduction in the presence of elevated aqueous nickel. We subsequently analyzed the composition of the microbial communities that became established and their potential for U(VI) reduction and its in situ immobilization. Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the microbial population changed from heavy metal sensitive members of the actinobacteria, α- and γ-proteobacteria to a community dominated by heavy metal resistant (nickel, cadmium, zinc, and cobalt resistant), nitrate reducing β- and γ-proteobacteria, and sulfate reducing Clostridiaceae. Coincidentally, synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses indicated that the resulting redox conditions favored U(VI) reduction transformation to insoluble U(IV) species associated with soil minerals and biomass. Discussion: This study shows that the necessary genetic information to adapt to the implemented nickel stress resides in the endogenous microbial population present at the Oak Ridge FRC site, which changed from a community generally found under oligotrophic conditions to a community able to withstand the stress imposed by heavy metals, while efficiently reducing nitrate as electron donor. Once nitrate was reduced efficient reduction and in situ immobilization of uranium was observed. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that stimulating the metabolism of the endogenous bacterial population at the Oak Ridge FRC site by adding ethanol, a suitable carbon source, results in efficient nitrate reduction under conditions of elevated nickel, and a decrease of the redox potential such that sulfate and iron reducing bacteria are able to thrive and create conditions favorable for the reduction and in situ immobilization of uranium. Since we have found that the remediation potential resides within the endogenous microbial community, we believe it will be feasible to conduct field tests. Recommendations and perspectives: Biostimulation of endogenous bacteria provides an efficient tool for the successful in situ remediation of mixed-waste sites, particularly those co-contaminated with heavy metals, nitrate and radionuclides, as found in the United States and other countries as environmental legacies of the nuclear age. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

This study reports the development of a chemical extraction methodology for remediation of soils contaminated with particulate DU. Uranium phases in soils from two sites at a UK firing range, MOD Eskmeals, were characterised by electron microscopy and sequential extraction. Uranium rich particles with characteristic spherical morphologies were observed in soils, consistent with other instances of DU munitions contamination. Batch extraction efficiencies for aqueous ammonium bicarbonate (42-50% total DU extracted), citric acid (30-42% total DU) and sulphuric acid (13-19% total DU) were evaluated. Characterisation of residues from bicarbonate-treated soils by synchrotron microfocus X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed partially leached U(IV)-oxide particles and some secondary uranyl-carbonate phases. Based on these data, a multi-stage extraction scheme was developed utilising leaching in ammonium bicarbonate followed by citric acid to dissolve secondary carbonate species.

	abstract = {Modern approaches for bioremediation of radionuclide contaminated environments are based on the ability of microorganisms to effectively catalyze changes in the oxidation states of metals that in turn influence their solubility. Although microbial metal reduction has been identified as an effective means for immobilizing highly-soluble uranium(VI) complexes in situ, the biomolecular mechanisms of U(VI) reduction are not well understood. Here, we show that c-type cytochromes of a dissimilatory metal-reducing bacterium, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, are essential for the reduction of U(VI) and formation of extracelluar UO2 nanoparticles. In particular, the outer membrane (OM) decaheme cytochrome MtrC (metal reduction), previously implicated in Mn(IV) and Fe(III) reduction, directly transferred electrons to U(VI). Additionally, deletions of mtrC and/or omcA significantly affected the in vivo U(VI) reduction rate relative to wild-type MR-1. Similar to the wild-type, the mutants accumulated UO2 nanoparticles extracellularly to high densities in association with an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). In wild-type cells, this UO2-EPS matrix exhibited glycocalyx-like properties and contained multiple elements of the OM, polysaccharide, and heme-containing proteins. Using a novel combination of methods including synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence microscopy and high-resolution immune-electron microscopy, we demonstrate a close association of the extracellular UO2 nanoparticles with MtrC and OmcA (outer membrane cytochrome). This is the first study to our knowledge to directly localize the OM-associated cytochromes with EPS, which contains biogenic UO2 nanoparticles. In the environment, such association of UO2 nanoparticles with biopolymers may exert a strong influence on subsequent behavior including susceptibility to oxidation by O2 or transport in soils and sediments. © 2006 Marshall et al.},

	abstract = {In this work, synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were carried out to elucidate at molecular scale the interaction mechanisms of Myxococcus xanthus with uranium at different pH values. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopic measurements showed that there are significant differences in the structural parameters of the U complexes formed by this bacterium at pH 2 and 4.5. At very low acidic pH of 2, the cells accumulated U(VI) as organic phosphate-metal complexes. At pH 4.5, however, the cells of this bacterium precipitated U(VI) as meta-autunite-like phase. TEM analyses demonstrated that at pH 2 the uranium accumulates were located mainly at the cell surface, whereas at pH 4.5 a uranium precipitation occurred on the cell wall and within the extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) characteristic of this bacterium. Dead/live staining studies showed that 30% and 50% of the uranium treated cell populations were alive at pH 2 and 4.5, respectively. The precipitation of U(VI) as mineral meta-autunite-like phase is possibly due to the bacterial acidic phosphatase activity. The precipitation of uranium as mineral phases may lead to more stable U(VI) sequestration that may be suitable for remediation purposes. These observations, combined with the very high uranium accumulation capability of the studied bacterial cells indicate that M. xanthus may significantly influence the fate of uranium in soil environments where these bacterial species are mainly found.},

	abstract = {Several leach solutions have been developed for the removal of uranium (U) from contaminated media such as soil and military catch-box sand used for the ballistics testing of U-containing projectiles. Leach solutions of concentrated sulfuric acid and of carbonate (with and without oxidants such as peroxides) have also been used in the mining of U from high-grade ore deposits. Many of these solutions have been used at U-contaminated environmental sites with varying degrees of success. Batch leaches with six characterized U-contaminated media and seven leach solutions were conducted. After the leach solutions were reacted with the media (five soils and a catch-box sand), the solutions were analyzed for dissolved U, Ca, Si, Fe, Mn, Pb and Cr. We study the ability of acidic, basic, acidic-oxidizing and basic-oxidizing solutions to leach U from contaminated media. The results suggest the removal efficiency of soil U for each leach solution varies with the nature of the U-contamination in the media and the media composition. It is likely the forms of U in the contaminated media such as reduced, absorbed, complexed and solid species influence the solubilization of U by the leaching agents.},
