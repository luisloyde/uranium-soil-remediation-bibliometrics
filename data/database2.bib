	abstract = {With rapid industrial development and population growth, the pollution of soil and groundwater has become a critical concern all over the world. Yet, remediation of contaminated soil and water remains a major challenge. In recent years, apatite has gained a surging interest in environmental remediation because of its high treatment efficiency, low cost, and environmental benignity. This review summarizes recent advances in: (1) natural apatite of phosphate ores and biological source; (2) synthesis of engineered apatite particles (including stabilized or surface-modified apatite nanoparticles); (3) treatment effectiveness of apatite towards various environmental pollutants in soil and groundwater, including heavy metals (e.g., Pb, Zn, Cu, Cd, and Ni), inorganic anions (e.g., As oxyanions and F−), radionuclides (e.g., thorium (Th), strontium (Sr), and uranium (U)), and organic pollutants (e.g., antibiotics, dyes, and pesticides); and (4) the removal and/or interaction mechanisms of apatite towards the different contaminants. Lastly, the knowledge or technology gaps are identified and future research needs are proposed. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {With our life being simplified through the usage of electronics, they do come with their baggage of rare earth and heavy metals, electronics is one of the major examples. The other reported sources of heavy metals in the environment include industrial, geogenic, pharmaceutical, domestic effluents, agricultural and atmospheric sources. Similarly, with the need for alternative energy compared to traditional fuels, radionuclides like uranium being a prime source of energy production in nuclear technology, some forms of these radiations are beneficial for energy generation, imaging technologies, etc. Along with the benefits, the shortcomings of the heavy metals as well as radionuclides when handled haphazardly is an alarming concern as it could be detrimental to all forms of life. Persistent deposition and leaching of heavy metals prompt a global concern to soil and water pollution. The accelerated growth of nuclear power plants has raised environmental issues associated with the usage of radionuclides. Majorly mining of these heavy metals and radionuclides leaves the areas around them heavily polluted. The solution to these issues relies on the utilization of bioremediation techniques, which are eco-friendly and economical in comparison with those of standard remediation techniques employed for heavy metal and radionuclides, which helps in reducing the toxic content of heavy metals and radionuclides. This shall avoid the creation of further by-products or reactions that would moreover need monitoring and cleansing processes. Several research studies utilize microbial, fungal, and algal strains that aid us in the bioremediation of radionuclides and heavy metals. The methodology of bioremediations majorly includes mechanisms such as bioaccumulation, biosorption, biotransformation, biomineralization are depended upon the organisms and the techniques involved. This chapter focuses solely on the emerging bioremediation technologies in the removing heavy metals and radionuclides with a sustainable approach. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.},

	abstract = {Exposure to excessive indoor radon causes around 500 lung cancer deaths in Sweden annually. However, until 2020, indoor radon measurements were only conducted in around 16% of Swedish single-family houses and 17% of multifamily houses. It is estimated that approximately 16% of single-family houses exceed the indoor radon reference level of 200 Bq/m3, and the corresponding situation in multifamily houses is unknown. Measuring indoor radon on an urban scale is complicated and costly. Statistical and machine learning, exploiting historical data for pattern identification, provides alternative approaches for assessing indoor radon risk in existing dwellings. By training MARS (Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines) and Random Forest (RF) regression models with the data labels from the radon measurement records in the Swedish Energy Performance Certification registers, property registers, soil maps, and the radiometric grids, the correlations between response and predictive variables can be untangled. The interplay of the key features, including uranium and thorium concentrations, ventilation systems, construction year, basements, and the number of floors, and their impact magnitudes on indoor radon concentrations, are investigated in the study. The regression models tailored for different building classes were developed and evaluated. Despite the data complexity, the RF models can explain 28% of the variance in multifamily houses, 24% in all buildings, and 21% in single-family houses. To improve model fitting, more intricate supervised learning algorithms should be explored in the future. The study outcomes can contribute to prioritizing remediation measures for building stocks suspected of high indoor radon risk.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Uranium is a naturally occurring radionuclide with chemical toxicity, derived from deposits formed through complex processes. In recent years, uranium utilization activities have increased uranium levels in the soil environment, posing serious threats to soil quality, food safety, and human health. Phytoextraction of uranium contamination is currently a cutting-edge topic that has attracted significant attentions. To date, several studies have examined the behavior and impact of uranium in various aspects of its mineralization and "soil-plant" system. Accordingly, we focused on the full life cycle of uranium within the "ore-soil-root-shoot" system, based on published work from 2015 to 2024, to provide an updated review of significant research findings and theories. Here, we present the following key aspects: (i) the factors influencing uranium mineralization, including material sources, transport processes, and precipitation mechanism; (ii) both natural and anthropogenic sources that contribute uranium entry into the soil; (iii) uranium toxicity generated by its radio- and chemo-toxicities; (iv) the toxic effects of uranium and plant detoxification; (v) the internal mechanisms of uranium uptake and translocation by plant roots; and (vi) the role of transpiration in the transport of uranium from roots to the aboveground plant parts. Phytoextraction is an eco-friendly and efficient method for remediation of uranium-contaminated soils, and combined measures such as chelating agents’ application and microbial inoculation are effective to obtain the satisfying results. We also identify and summarize the gaps in current research, providing a reference for future related studies. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Seepage of uranium tailings has become a focus of attention in the uranium mining and metallurgy industry, and in-situ microbial remediation is considered an effective way to treat uranium pollution. However, this method has the drawbacks of easy biomass loss and unstable remediation effect. To overcome these issues, spare red soil around the uranium mine was used to enhance the efficiency and stability of bioremediation. Furthermore, the bioremediation mechanism was revealed by employing XRD, FTIR, XPS, and 16S rRNA. The results showed that red soil, as a barrier material, had the adsorption potential of 8.21–148.00 mg U/kg soil, but the adsorption is accompanied by the release of certain acidic and oxidative substances. During the dynamic microbial remediation, red soil was used as a cover material to neutralize acidity, provide a higher reduction potential (<-200 mV), and increase the retention rate of microbial agent (19.06 mL/d) compared to the remediation group without red soil. In the presence of red soil, the anaerobic system could maintain the uranium concentration in the solution below 0.3 mg/L for more than 70 days. Moreover, the generation of new clay minerals driven by microorganisms was more conducive to the stability of uranium tailings. Through alcohol and amino acid metabolism of microorganisms, a reducing environment with reduced valence states of multiple elements (such as S2−, Fe2+, and U4+) was formed. At the same time, the relative abundance of functional microbial communities in uranium tailings improved in presence of red soil and Desulfovirobo, Desulfocapsa, Desulfosporosinus, and other active microbial communities reconstructed the anaerobic environment. The study provides a new two-in-one solution for treatment of uranium tailings and resource utilization of red soil through in-situ microbial remediation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Uranium (U) pollution in soil resulted by human activities is a critical environmental issue. Goethite and humic acid (HA), as predominant soil constituents, significantly influence the migration and transformation of uranium in soil, but effects of combining them together on the sequestration and immobilization of U at different mineralization condition are still rare. To simulate the ability of different combinations of HA and goethite to limit the migration of uranium (VI) in the soil environment, the humic acid-modified goethite (OPHG, TSHG) were synthesized by one-pot and two steps synthesis methods in this study. After modified by HA, the specific surface area of materials increased from 29.67 m2/g to 121.53 m2/g and 39.89 m2/g respectively. The effects of dosage, contact time, pH, initial concentration and temperature on the removal of U(VI) by goethite and modified goethite were investigated. The results showed the maximum difference of them reached 41.59% and 15.69 mg/g for reaction 60 min at pH=4.5. The equilibrium adsorption data fit to the pseudo-second-order kinetics and Langmuir models, and the maximum adsorption capacities increased from 64.63 mg/g to 92.04 mg/g. The analyses results indicated that OPHG remove U(VI) mainly through the formation of ≡FeOUO2OH between Fe−O and uranyl ions, as well as the complexation of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on HA molecules with uranium to form the HA-Goethite-U(VI) ternary complexes FeOHAUO2. These results are benefited for understanding the effects of HA and goethite on immobilization uranium in soil and would be used to predict and remediate the polluted soil. © 2024},

Above 90% soil samples had high content of chloride, sodium and potassium. Cadmium, arsenic, zinc and lead in 100%, 76.67%, 76.67% and 66.67% samples exceeded their safe limits (mg/kg; 0.06, 20, 50 and 10, respectively). Individual/multi-elemental indices indicated high PTEs contamination in soils posing low to considerable ecological risk. Principal components PCI and PCII contributed 44.748% and 30.476% variance in data, respectively. PTEs in soils were classified in two categories using cluster analysis (I: Cd, U, Co, Pb, Ni, Cr, As, Cu, Zn and Mn; II: Fe), indicating both geogenic and anthropogenic origins. Health risks due to PTE exposure via dermal contact, inhalation and ingestion were also assessed. Children were found to be highly prone to non-cancer health risk (mean hazard index = 1.30) by As exposure, mainly via ingestion pathway. High total cancer risk was posed to residents via As (7.52E-05) and Cr (9.17E-06) exposure, primarily through ingestion.

	abstract = {Uranium (U) contamination often occurs in the topsoil (arable layer), and is a serious threat to crop growth. However, conventional microbial reduction methods are sensitive to oxygen and cannot be used to treat aerobic topsoils. In this study, phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms (PSM) were isolated from U-contaminated topsoil and used for soil remediation. Microbial metabolites and products were analyzed, and the pathways and mechanisms of PSM immobilization were revealed. The results showed that strain PSM8 had the highest phosphate-solubilizing capacity (dissolved P was 208 ± 5 mg/L) and the highest U removal rate (97.3 ± 0.1%). Multi-technical analyses indicated that bacterial surface functional groups adsorbed (UO2)2+ ions on the cell surface, glycolysis produced 3–10 mg/L of lactic acid (pH 4.7–6.0), and lactic acid solubilized Ca3(PO4)2 to form stable chernikovite (a type of uranyl phosphate) on the cell surface. The coupled application of Ca3(PO4)2 and strain PSM8 significantly reduced the bioavailability of soil U (62 ± 11%), converting U from the exchangeable to the residual phase and P from the steady to the available form. In addition, pot experiments showed that soil remediation promoted crop growth and significantly reduced U uptake and toxicity to photosynthetic systems. These findings demonstrate that PSM and Ca3(PO4)2 are good coupled fertilizers for U-contaminated agricultural soil. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In recent years the quest for a circular economy approach and the upcycling of secondary raw materials have been pushed in the global political agenda. Increased interest has been taken by the recovery of materials from sludges, brines, contaminated waters and other media, all included in the larger umbrella identified as “low-grade” mineralisation. Contaminated soils have an interesting role in this process, and various methodologies have been developed using chemical, bacteriological and pyrometallurgical cleaning procedures. However, these procedures all involve the movement of high volume of materials and the disruption of the industrial landscape; furthermore, they often require the use of hazardous solvents and high energy processes. This work proposes to identify less impactful methods aimed at the recovery of metals from mining areas while preserving the landscape and avoiding environmental impacts such as the increase of CO2 for transport and increase hazard through use of solvents, this takes particular importance in areas of industrial heritage status. In particular, this work focuses on the use of Agrostis tenuis, an autochthonous species in mining areas of the UK, as a “mining tool” for the removal of lead. The selection of this plant is due to its visually non-invasive nature, as the plant is already present in these areas, it doesn’t grow above 10/15 cm and it also grows very fast and can be easily harvested with existing agricultural equipment. The experiments and results presented in this paper indicate: (1) Agrostis Tenuis shows the ability to adjust to contamination and increase its accumulation capacity; (2) the metal collected by the plant is fully transposed in the aerial part of the plant in a stable compound form and can consequently be harvested and further processed. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Groundwater is an essential source for drinking water production. Nitrate infiltration into groundwater due to over-fertilization can cause a potential risk for groundwater quality. Pyrite and other geogenic minerals can be oxidized and trace metals consequently released into water, e.g., nickel and uranium. To achieve a better understanding of the nitrate-induced mobilization of metals, this study investigated the release of antimony, arsenic, chromium, cobalt, molybdenum, uranium, and vanadium from three different reduced sediments after nitrate addition. The experiments were conducted as batch and soil column tests under oxygen-free conditions. In addition to the ORP, the pH value was a relevant driver for the metal mobilization due to pH dependent adsorption and ion exchange processes. Uranium concentrations in the water increased with increasing redox potential. Also, antimony and, to a lesser extent, molybdenum showed higher mobilization at higher ORP as well as at higher pH values. On the contrary, arsenic and cobalt was immobilized with increasing redox potential. Pourbaix diagrams demonstrated very complex species distributions even in synthetic water. The mobilization of trace metals is expected to be also influenced by the type of surrounding rocks and water quality parameters such as dissolved organic carbon. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {As the need for global decommissioning and site remediation of aging and shut-down nuclear power plants continues to grow, it becomes increasingly crucial to efficiently treat contaminated soil while minimizing waste generation. This study explores an innovative soil decontamination approach that utilizes supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO₂) as the primary solvent, along with ethanol as a co-solvent and specific additives, including a chelate ligand (catechol ligand) and a co-ligand (NEt₄PFOSA). The advantages of SCCO₂, such as its penetration and solubility, coupled with its ability to separate from radioactive waste, are harnessed in this research. The study demonstrates that the combination of SCCO₂, ethanol, and additives significantly enhances decontamination efficiency, particularly for cesium (Cs), strontium (Sr), and uranium (U) contamination. Results indicate that decontamination efficiency varies with soil particle size, with smaller particles presenting greater challenges. This study presents a promising eco-friendly soil decontamination technology using SCCO₂ containing ethanol and specific additives to efficiently reduce radioactive contamination in soil. © 2024},

	abstract = {To mitigate groundwater level decline, managed aquifer recharge (MAR) with secondary treated wastewater (STWW) is increasingly considered and implemented. However, the effectiveness and potential risks of such systems need evaluation prior to implementation. In this study, we present a large-scale sand tank experiment to analyse processes related to the infiltration of real STWW through the vadose zone and subsequent mixing with oxic native groundwater. The varying composition of STWW from 15 infiltration cycles over six months of operation and the retention times were the main drivers of the observed processes, which were characterized by a wide range of analytical techniques such as in situ high-resolution oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) measurements, closed mass balances of solutes, characterization of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), stable nitrate isotopes analysis, as well as numerical flow and transport modelling. Depending on the composition and infiltration rates of the STWW, both nitrification and denitrification could be observed, even simultaneously at different locations in the tank. Furthermore, due to the variability of the real STWW we observed enhanced arsenic mobilisation during times of elevated phosphate concentrations of the infiltrating STWW. Additionally, uranium was mobilised in our experimental system via carbonate mineral dissolution caused by the infiltrating STWW which was undersaturated of calcite for all infiltration cycles. Overall, our results showed the importance of conducting studies with waters of complex matrix, such as real STWW, and considering mixing with groundwater to assess the full range of possible processes encountered at MAR field sites. © 2024},

This study determined the soil composition at the tailings dumping site using particle-induced X-ray emission, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction and observed the adsorption structure of barium (Ba), an analog of Ra, using X-ray absorption fine structure analysis. The results revealed the existence of silicate minerals, such as quartz and mica, and metal oxides, such as Fe and Mn, in the soil. Ningyo-toge soil is similar to montmorillonite and bentonite. In particular, it was proposed that the adsorption of Ba on Mn oxide is an inner-sphere complex that immobilizes Ba.

	abstract = {In alkaline soil, abundant carbonates will mobilize uranium (U) and increase its ecotoxicity, which is a serious threat to crop growth. However, the knowledge of U remediation in alkaline soils remains very limited. In this study, U-contaminated alkaline soil (tillage layer) was collected from the Ili mining area of Xinjiang, the soil remediation was carried out by using phosphorus (P) fertilizers of different solubility (including KH2PO4, Ca(H2PO4)2, CaHPO4, and Ca3(PO4)2), and the pathways and mechanisms of U passivation in the alkaline soil were revealed. The results showed that water-soluble P fertilizers, KH2PO4 and Ca(H2PO4)2, were highly effective at immobilizing U, and significantly reduced the bioavailability of soil U. The exchangeable U was reduced by 70.5 ± 0.1% (KH2PO4) and 68.2 ± 1.9% (Ca(H2PO4)2), which was converted into the Fe–Mn oxide-bound and residual phases. Pot experiments showed that soil remediation by KH2PO4 significantly promoted crop growth, especially for roots, and reduced U uptake in crops by 94.5 ± 1.0%. The immobilization of U by KH2PO4 could be attributed to the release of phosphate anions, which react with the uranyl ion (UO22+) forming a stable mineral of meta-ankoleite and enhancing the binding of UO22+ to the soil Fe–Mn oxides. In addition, KH2PO4 dissolution produces acidity and P fertilizer, which can reduce soil alkalinity and improve crop growth. The findings in this work demonstrate that a rational application of P fertilizer can effectively, conveniently, and cheaply remediate U contamination and improve crop yield and safety on alkaline farmland. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

The relationships between U biogeochemical transformation and its bioavailability in soil are significantly affected by soil redox potential, pH, metal (hydr)oxides, organic matter, and microorganisms. The toxicity/detoxification mechanisms of U in plants and microorganisms have been extensively studied, and further studies should combine with omics techniques (proteomics, genomics, and metabolomics) to narrow the knowledge gaps in molecular mechanisms. Moreover, the mechanisms and applicability of phytoremediation and microbial bioremediation in U-contaminated soils were summarized. Based on the present review, we further propose several critical challenges and directions for improving our knowledge and remediation strategies of U contamination in the soil-plant system. This review would help us better understand the geochemical behavior of U in soil-plant systems and its potential risks to human health. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {In this study, we investigated the effect of detoxifying substances on U(VI) removal by bacteria isolated from mine soil. The results demonstrated that the highest U(VI) removal efficiency (85.6%) was achieved at pH 6.0 and a temperature of 35 °C, with an initial U(VI) concentration of 10 mg/L. For detoxifying substances, signaling molecules acyl homoserine lactone (AHLs, 0.1 µmol/L), anthraquinone-2, 6-disulfonic acid (AQDS, 1 mmol/L), reduced glutathione (GSH, 0.1 mmol/L), selenium (Se, 1 mg/L), montmorillonite (MT, 1 g/L), and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, 0.1 mmol/L) substantially enhanced the bacterial U(VI) removal by 34.9%, 37.4%, 54.5%, 35.1%, 32.8%, and 47.8% after 12 h, respectively. This was due to the alleviation of U(VI) toxicity in bacteria through detoxifying substances, as evidenced by lower malondialdehyde (MDA) content and higher superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities for bacteria exposed to U(VI) and detoxifying substances, compared to those exposed to U(VI) alone. FTIR results showed that hydroxyl, carboxyl, phosphorus, and amide groups participated in the U(VI) removal. After exposure to U(VI), the relative abundances of Chryseobacterium and Stenotrophomonas increased by 48.5% and 12.5%, respectively, suggesting their tolerance ability to U(VI). Gene function prediction further demonstrated that the detoxifying substances AHLs alleviate U(VI) toxicity by influencing bacterial metabolism. This study suggests the potential application of detoxifying substances in the U(VI)-containing wastewater treatment through bioremediation. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Phytoremediation is a green and cheap remediation technology for metal/radionuclide-contaminated sites. Radium is often of particular interest and there are many literatures on parameters of Ra concentration in plants and transfer factors from soil to plant from a radiological impact assessment point of view. However, review articles on phytoremediation of Ra-polluted soil are relatively few. This review focused on radium-polluted soil phytoremediation, involving two main strategies of phytoextraction and phytostabilization, which covered the potential (hyper)accumulators for Ra, characteristics of Ra uptake from soil by plants, influencing factors, and phytostabilization application. In future research works, more attention should be paid to the deep insights and mechanism researches of Ra uptake/immobilization by plants. This review will deepen the understanding of the relationship of radium-soil-plants, and to enhance the potential application of phytoremediation as an alternative treatment technology for remediation of Ra-polluted soil site. © 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

	abstract = {A series of laboratory experiments are conducted to simulate the acidification and subsequent recovery of a sand aquifer exploited by in situ recovery (ISR) mining. A sulfuric acid solution (pH 2) is first injected into a column packed with sand from the Zoovch Ovoo uranium roll front deposit (Mongolia). Solutions representative of local groundwater or enriched in cations (Na+, Mg2+) are then circulated through the column to simulate the inflow of aquifer water. pH and major ion concentrations (Na+, Cl−, SO42−, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+) measured at the column outlet reproduce the overall evolution of porewater chemistry observed in the field. The presence of minor quantities of swelling clay minerals (≈6 wt% smectite) is shown to exert an important influence on the behavior of inorganic cations, particularly H+, via ion-exchange reactions. Numerical models that consider ion-exchange on smectite as the sole solid-solution interaction are able to reproduce variations in pH and cation concentrations in the column experiments. This highlights the importance of clay minerals in controlling H+ mobility and demonstrates that sand from the studied aquifer can be described to a first order as an ion-exchanger. The present study confirms the key role of clay minerals in controlling water chemistry in acidic environments through ion-exchange processes. In a context of managing the long-term environmental footprint of industrial and mining activities (ISR, acid mine drainage…), this work will bring insights for modeling choices and identification of key parameters to help operators to define their production and/or remediation strategies. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Environment pollution is increasing rapidly by the growing demand for industrial installation to meet the need of the multiplying population. Industrialization has caused many problems like polluting land resources by heavy metals. Heavy metals are economically significant in industries which are now becoming a serious ecological threat all over the world. Metals play an essential role in the biological functions of plants and animals at low and limited concentrations. As we know that plants play significant roles in the food chain, but an aggregation of heavy metal ions can lead to severe food chain pollution, which poses many health risks to living organisms. Nickel (Ni), gold (Au), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), selenium (Se), mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), uranium (Ur), zinc (Zn), chromium (Cr), and silver (Ag) are some of the heavy metals which are harmful to plants growth. These heavy metals affect the photosynthetic processes, the nourishment of plant’s mineral, and delay of crucial enzyme function. Plants growing in certain areas are already exposed to a high concentration of heavy metal ions. Soil and lands are already being contaminated by these metal ions via extreme use of fertilizers, pesticides, and manure, which lead to reduced crop production and food quality. In this chapter, we summarized different microbes which are potentially known to be effective and economical to aid in elimination of heavy metals from the environment (soil, air, water). Microorganisms are emerging as important players in controlling the contagious heavy metals present in the environment. These microbes have the capacity to degrade, cleanse, and even store harmful organic and inorganic substances. Because of their outstanding ability of bioremediation, their use is increasing in agricultural sector. This chapter includes the mechanism and strategies through which the detoxification, removal, and immobilization of heavy metals is performed by microbes in environment. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

MPCA keeps maximum adsorption proportion of uranium (≥60.01 %) in the mixed multi-nuclide solution, and high adsorption capacity in different natural simulated uranium-contaminated water systems. In the engineering remediation of natural uranium-contaminated soil, MPCA removes 83.9 % of uranium and 99.8 % of radium in muddy water, even removes 92.9 % of uranium in the soil leaching wastewater. This work also validates a promising green engineering linked soil remediation technology, which combines soil leaching and adsorption separation. The remediated soil meets international emission standards, 92.9 % of uranium in the leachate is removed, 93.2 % of adsorbed uranium is desorbed and enriched.

	abstract = {The aim of this work was to study the chemical composition and physicochemical properties of humic substances isolated from lowland peat, including their ability to sorb and permanently bind naturally occurring radioactive elements uranium, radium, and thorium. In this work, functional, infrared spectroscopic, and elemental analyses confirmed that the molecules of the humic substances under study contain a large number of reactive groups, which can participate in the processes of sorption of toxic substances. Along with the aromatic character of the studied preparations, a strong branching of the side chains and a high degree of condensation and oxidation of the macromolecules were established. It was also revealed that the exchange capacity indices of the studied humic substances exceed the corresponding characteristics for the known plant-based sorbents by a multiple. Under conditions of static sorption experiment it was established that during a 24-hour contact with solutions of uranyl, radium and thorium nitrates, humic acid preparations sorb up to 74 % of the content of radioactive elements from the liquid phase. Up to 21.8 % of this amount is extracted only by strongly acidic desorbent solutions, a significant amount (up to 45.5 %) was recorded in the structure of humicates. As a rule, a higher proportion of radionuclides irreversibly fixed in sorbents is observed for the sodium form of huminate. The obtained data demonstrate the high potential of the studied humic preparations in the processes of soil remediation. © Siberian Federal University. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The low bioavailability of insoluble uranium to plants limits the applicability of phytoremediation for decontaminating uranium-contaminated soil. Chelating agents can change the non-absorbable and unusable form of uranium in soil to a state that can be easily absorbed and utilized by plants, thereby helping the roots absorb the mobilized uranium. However, it is often difficult for plants to absorb large amounts of mobilized uranium in a short period of time, which may lead to plant poisoning and increase the risk of uranium leaching into groundwater, causing secondary pollution. In this study, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of the chelating agent-induced phytoremediation of heavy metal and radionuclide contaminated soils from 1996 to 2023. Moreover, the potential environmental risks of chelating agent-mediated phytoremediation were summarized. In order to reduce the rate of uranium mobilization in soil, a slow-release technique was proposed to control the release rate of chelating agents. Therefore, a review was conducted on representative biodegradable slow-release carrier materials, and the release mechanism of slow-release chelating agents was investigated. Finally, the development trends and effects of slow-release chelating agent-induced phytoextraction technology were discussed with the aim of providing an approach for applying such chemical agents in the phytoremediation of uranium-contaminated soils. The following points were concluded from the obtained results. (1) The most widely used chelating agents include those based on aminopolycarboxylates (represented by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid) and low-molecular-weight organic acids (represented by citric acid) and the most widely used hyperaccumulators include Indian mustard, sunflower, and ryegrass with uranium enrichment abilities. (2) Although chelating agents can improve the efficiency of uranium phytoextraction, their toxicity and residual effects may lead to plant poisoning, interference with microbial communities, and decrease in soil quality. Additionally, plants are unable to absorb a large amount of mobilized uranium in a short period of time, which may increase the risk of heavy metals leaching from soil into groundwater. (3) Representative biodegradable slow-release carrier materials can be categorized as natural polymers, synthetic polymers, and inorganic materials. Because a single carrier material has the disadvantage of poor mechanical strength, it is necessary to modify it to extend its slow-release period. (4) The release mechanism of slow-release chelating agents can be divided into three stages: water adsorption, coating/substrate expansion, and water diffusion. (5) The processes used to prepare existing slow-release chelating agents involve a variety of toxic and harmful chemicals. The research show that developing a green synthesis technology for preparing biodegradable slow-release chelating agent is needed to ensure a green and sustainable remediation process. © 2024 Editorial Board, Research of Environmental Sciences.

	abstract = {Agricultural soil contaminated by phosphogypsum pile stocked in plan air remains a major problem in M’Dhilla city southwestern of Tunisia. The present effort aimed to enhance the knowledge of trace elements and radioactivity abundance and to assess the corresponding environment. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy was used to evaluate the trace elements, radioactive elements, and major element concentrations. Our finding revealed that the mean values of U and Th in all the soil profiles ranged from 0.283 to 2.875 mg.kg−1 and from 0.797 to 1.491 mg.kg−1 respectively. The statistical analyses indicated that uranium abundance has non-significant correlation with the most of trace metals; it shows a moderate correlated with Sr and inverse correlation with P2O5. Contamination factors indicate that the studied soil ranged from uncontaminated to significantly contaminated. Thus, the pollution load index values classify the sites from background values to high pollution sites. The findings of this study will help improve the environmental conditions of M’Dhilla city by addressing contamination issues through targeted interventions. The study’s findings highlight the importance of a periodic environmental monitoring such as soil remediation in the study area.

The results showed that the removal efficiency of uranium decreased with the increase of initial uranium concentration. When the uranium initial concentration was 5 mg/L, the uranium removal efficiency achieved 92.1%. The increase of temperature could promote the uranium removal. Carbon source could affect the removal rate of uranium, which was the fastest when the methanol was used as carbon source. The solution pH had significant effect on the uranium removal efficiency, which reached the maximum under solution pH 5.0. The experimental results and FTIR as well as XPS demonstrated that Priestia sp. WW1 could remove uranium via both adsorption and reduction. The common chloride ions, sulfate ions, Mn(II) and Cu(II) enhanced the uranium removal, while Fe(III) depressed the uranium removal. The Priestia sp. WW1 could effectively remove the uranium in the actual mining groundwater, and the increase of initial biomass could improve the removal efficiency of uranium in the actual mining groundwater.

	abstract = {Improper disposal practices have caused environmental disruptions, possessing by heavy metal ions and radioactive elements in water and soil, where the innovative and sustainable remediation strategies are significantly imperative in last few decades. Microbially induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) has emerged as a pioneering technology for remediating contaminated soil and water. Generally, MICP employs urease-producing microorganisms to decompose urea (NH2CONH2) into ammonium (NH4 +and carbon dioxide (CO2), thereby increasing pH levels and inducing carbonate precipitation (CO3 2−), and effectively removing remove contaminants. Nonetheless, the intricate mechanism underlying heavy metal mineralization poses a significant challenge, constraining its application in contaminants engineering, particularly in the context of prolonged heavy metal leaching over time and its efficacy in adverse environmental conditions. This review provides a comprehensive idea of recent development of MICP and its application in environmental engineering, examining metabolic pathways, mineral precipitation mechanisms, and environmental factors as well as providing future perspectives for commercial utilization. The use of ureolytic bacteria in MICP demonstrates cost-efficiency, environmental compatibility, and successful pollutant abatement over tradition bioremediation techniques, and bio-synthesis of nanoparticles. limitations such as large-scale application, elevated Ca2+levels in groundwater, and gradual contaminant release need to be overcome.

	abstract = {Although biological remediation of U-stressed soil has been studied for a long time, the combined effects of biochar and plant roots are rarely discussed and its influence on rhizosphere microecology are still unknown. Based on pot experiments, we explored the combined efforts of biochar addition and plant roots on U-stressed rhizosphere soil in several ways, including soil physicochemical properties, soil enzyme activities, uranium chemical speciation, bacterial community structure and metabolic pathways. Our results indicates that the content of DTPA-extractable U decreased by 49.31% after biochar and plant roots application, whereas plant roots only treatment just decreased by 25.46%. Further research has found that the pH, CEC, enzyme activities and nutritional level of rhizosphere soil were more significantly improved after biochar and plant roots application. Meanwhile, the abundance and diversity of bacterial community was also upregulated, which was also suggested by the stronger metabolisms of lipids, carbohydrate, nucleotides as well as amino acids. Correlation analyses also certified the positive associations between soil properties, bacterial communities and metabolism. We speculated that the uranium immobilization was mainly attributed to the direct fixation of biochar for its alkalinity, CEC, DOC, etc. and the joint action of biochar and plant roots for their stimulating effects on bacteria. Our findings suggested that combination of biochar and plant roots could limit bioaccessibility of U in a larger extend than plant roots only, which may be a better strategy for rapid remediation of U-streesed soil. © 2023},

	abstract = {In low-lying land, the impact of agriculture on flooding has focussed on soil compaction, whilst in the uplands there has been more interest in the influence of afforestation. The potential effect of acidification of previously limed upland grassland soils on this risk has been overlooked. The marginal economics of upland farms has led to inadequate lime application on these grasslands. In Wales, UK, agronomic improvement of upland acid grasslands with liming was widespread in the last century. The extent and topographical distribution of this land use in Wales was estimated and these characteristics were mapped in four catchments studied in more detail. Then 41 sites on improved pastures within the catchments were sampled, where lime had not been applied for periods of between two and 30 years; unimproved acid pastures adjacent to five of these sites were also sampled. Soil pH, organic matter, infiltration rates and earthworm populations were recorded. Grasslands at risk of acidification without maintenance liming were estimated to cover almost 20 % of upland Wales. The majority of these grasslands were located on steeper slopes (gradients >7o) where any reduction in infiltration would promote surface runoff and limit rainwater retention. The extent of these pastures varied markedly between the four study catchments. There was a 6-fold reduction in infiltration rates between high and low pH soils, and this trend was correlated with reductions in anecic earthworm abundance. The vertical burrows of these earthworms are important for infiltration and no such earthworms were present in the most acidic soils. Recently limed soils had infiltration rates similar to those of unimproved acid pastures. Soil acidification has the potential to exacerbate flood risk but further research is needed to assess the extent of any impact. Modelling of catchment specific flood risk should include the extent of upland soil acidification as an additional land use factor. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {For a broader understanding of uranium migration affected by microorganisms in natural anaerobic environment, the bioreduction of uranium(Ⅵ) (U(Ⅵ)) was revealed in Bacillus thuringiensis, a dominant bacterium strain with potential of uranium-tolerant isolated from uranium contaminated soil. The reduction behavior was systematically investigated by the quantitative analysis of U(Ⅳ) in bacteria, and mechanism was inferred from the pathway of electron transmission. Under anaerobic conditions, appropriate biomass and sodium lactate as electron donor, reduction behavior of U(Ⅵ) induced by B. thuringiensis was restricted by the activity of lactate dehydrogenase, which was directly affected by the initial pH, temperature and initial U(Ⅵ) concentration of bioreduction system. Bioreduction of U(Ⅵ) was driven by the generation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) from enzymatic reaction of sodium lactate with various dehydrogenase. The transmission of the electrons from bacteria to U(Ⅵ) was mainly supported by the intracellular NADH dehydrogenase-ubiquinone system, this process could maintain the biological activity of cells. © 2022},

	abstract = {Uranium biomineralization can slow uranium migration in the environment and thus prevent it from further contaminating the surroundings. Investigations into the uranium species, pH, inorganic phosphate (Pi) concentration, and microbial viability during biomineralization by microorganisms are crucial for understanding the mineralization mechanism. In this study, Bacillus thuringiensis X-27 was isolated from soil contaminated with uranium and was used to investigate the formation process of uranium biominerals induced by X-27. The results showed that as biomineralization proceeded, amorphous uranium-containing deposits were generated and transformed into crystalline minerals outside cells, increasing the overall concentration of uramphite. This is a cumulative rather than abrupt process. Notably, B. thuringiensis X-27 precipitated uranium outside the cell surface within 0.5 h, while the release of Pi into the extracellular environment and the change of pH to alkalescence further promoted the formation of uramphite. In addition, cell viability determination showed that the U(VI) biomineralization induced by B. thuringiensis X-27 was instrumental in alleviating the toxicity of U(VI) to cells. This work offers insight into the mechanism of U(VI) phosphate biomineralization and is a reference for bioremediation-related studies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

With the delineation of the ecological red line and the increasing attention of the people to ecological and environmental issues, environmental restoration of uranium mines becomes more and more important. This article briefly introduces the mining methods of uranium mines in southern China, systematically analyzes the impact of the production process of uranium mines on the environment, focuses on the principles and applications of physical, chemical, and biological remediation measures, summarizes the corresponding advantages and disadvantages, and prospects the future development of mine restoration. It was pointed out that the next step should be focused on environmental testing before the decommissioning of uranium mines and related facilities, and comprehensive environmental data collection and recording of the entire production process of the mine. Close attention should be paid to the treatment and disposal of wastewater from uranium mines, increase research investment, learn from foreign advanced technology and methods, and use comprehensive repair technology to repair the polluted environment more efficiently, safely and quickly. The restoration of uranium mines would be combined with rural governance, develop tourism, and increase the development motivation and income levels of local residents. © 2024 Editorial Department of Multipurpose Utilization of Mineral Resources.

Neural networks (NN) are emerging as a new candidate for performing these tasks as an alternative to conventional geostatistical tools such as Co-Kriging. This study demonstrates the implementation of a NN for estimating radiological values such as ambient dose equivalent (H*(10)), surface activity and activity concentrations of natural radionuclides present in a waste dump of a Cu mine with a high level of natural radionuclides. The results obtained using a NN were compared with those estimated by Co-Kriging. Both models reproduced field measurements equivalently as a function of spatial coordinates. Similarly, the deviations from the reference concentration values obtained in the output layer of the NN were smaller than the deviations obtained from the multiple regression analysis (MRA), as indicated by the results of the root mean square error. Finally, the method validation showed that the estimation of radiological parameters based on their spatial coordinates faithfully reproduced the affected area. The estimation of the activity concentrations was less accurate for both the NN and MRA; however, both methods gave statistically comparable results for activity concentrations obtained by gamma spectrometry (Student's t-test and Fisher's F-test). © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Coal fly ash (CFA) is an essential raw material in brickmaking industry worldwide. There are some coal mines with a relatively high content of uranium (U) in the Xinjiang region of China that are yet understudied. The CFA from these coal mines poses substantial environmental risks due to the concentrated uranium amount after coal burning. In this paper, we demonstrated a calcifying ureolytic bacterium Halomonas sp. SBC20 for its biocementation of U in CFA based on microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP). Rectangle-shaped CFA bricks were made from CFA using bacterial cells, and an electric testing machine tested their compressive strength. U distribution pattern and immobility against rainfall runoff were carefully examined by a five-stage U sequential extraction method and a leaching column test. The microstructural changes in CFA bricks were characterized by FTIR and SEM-EDS methods. The results showed that the compressive strength of CFA bricks after being cultivated by bacterial cells increased considerably compared to control specimens. U mobility was significantly decreased in the exchangeable fraction, while the U content was markedly increased in the carbonate-bound fraction after biocementation. Much less U was released in the leaching column test after the treatment with bacterial cells. The FTIR and SEM-EDX methods confirmed the formation of carbonate precipitates and the incorporation of U into the calcite surfaces, obstructing the release of U into the surrounding environments. The technology provides an effective and economical treatment of U-contaminated CFA, which comes from coal mines with high uranium content in the Xinjiang region, even globally. © 2024},

	abstract = {With increasing globalization and industrialization, man has been trying to utilize nature and its resources for its benefit. This has led to an indiscriminate use of natural resources and some regions of the world are highly contaminated with uranium (U). Although various studies have been carried out all over the world concerning air, water, and soil pollution; pollution due to radioactive elements such as U, Thorium (Th), etc. has been receiving greater attention in the past few decades. Due to the ubiquitous presence of U, it occurs in trace amounts in various foods and in drinking water, which significantly increases human health risks. Moreover, an increase in the concentration of U from its normal concentration is hazardous due to its radioactive nature, consequently, its excessive presence is a significant potential risk to the environment and the environment's health. In contrast, to physical and chemical methods for U remediation, microbial and Due to its ease of use, low cost, and environmentally friendly nature, phytoremediation techniques are widely used. Therefore, it is crucial to comprehend how plants and microorganisms are exploited and used in soil U remediation. The toxic and detoxification processes of U in plants and microbes will be thoroughly investigated. Moreover, in this chapter, the mechanisms and applicability of microbial bioremediation and phytoremediation in U-contaminated soils will be summarized. This chapter will aid in a better understanding of how U behaves in soil-plant systems and the possible concerns it poses to human health. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Since the 1990s, sandstone-type uranium in the northern basin of China has become the main target for mining. Uranium mining can cause a series of impacts on the environment. A conceptual model of the geo-environment for sandstone-type uranium in northern China was described, which covers the changes in the geo-environmental characteristics in the natural state, in the mining process, during decommissioning and after treatment. Sandstone-type uranium is mainly distributed in the Songliao, Erlian, Ordos, Turpan–Hami and Ili Basins, which have arid climates and poor stratum permeability. Pitchblende is the main uranium-bearing mineral and is associated with iron, copper, coal, organic matter and other minerals. The mineral often has a low ore grade (0.01–1.0%) and high carbonate content (2–25%). Uranyl carbonate accounts for more than 90% of the total uranium in groundwater. The uranyl content is closely related to the TDS. The TDS of groundwater in the eastern and central ore belts is usually lower than 2 g/L, while in the western region, such as Xinjiang, it can exceed 10 g/L. In situ leaching (ISL) is the main mining method that results in groundwater pollution. Acid leaching leads to a pH decrease (<3), and heavy metals represented by U and Fe exceed the background values by hundreds of times, resulting in groundwater pollution. CO2 leaching is more environmentally friendly, and the excess ions are usually Ca2+, Mg2+, NO3− and HCO3−. Soil chemical anomalies originate mostly from wind erosion and precipitation leaching of decommissioned tailings. Uranium pollution is mainly concentrated within 20 cm of the surface, and the exceedance generally varies from two to 40 times. During ISL, a series of environmental measures will be taken to prevent pollution from being exposed to the surface. After treatment, the decommissioned uranium mines will likely have no impact on the surrounding environment. In the future, the protection of groundwater should be strengthened during production, and remediation methods based on electrokinetic, microbial and permeable reactive barrier (PRB) technology should be further researched. © 2023 by the authors.},

Based on the optimal ratio and operating conditions determined from laboratory-scale trials, a pilot-scale trial was conducted around a uranium mining area: soil leaching remediation was conducted in two 3 m3 soil-slurry reactors to verify the practicality of the leaching technology and examine the functionality of the remediated soil. The experimental results showed that the rate of uranium removal from contaminated soil by the chemical leaching method was greater than 80%. FTIR, XRF and enzyme activity analysis proved that remediation restored the original soil function and reduced the ecological risk, indicating that the chemical leaching technology was environmentally friendly and economical.

	abstract = {The city of Fallujah, Iraq experienced extensive bombardment during recent military conflicts. However, limited environmental sampling has occurred to assess potential contamination. This study aimed to measure soil concentrations of heavy metals across Fallujah to determine the current levels of environmental pollution. We collected 117 surface soil samples in a grid pattern across Fallujah. Samples were analyzed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) to quantify the levels of 13 elements. Geographic information systems (GIS) mapping visualized the spatial distribution of metals. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) identified contaminant groupings. Multiple heavy metals were detected at concerning levels, including uranium, thorium, lead, and arsenic. Uranium and thorium were elevated in several areas, indicating potential contamination from depleted uranium munitions. FA results pointed to two primary exposure sources: burn pits in central Fallujah and industrial activity in the east. This study revealed heavy metal contamination in Fallujah soil, likely arising from military activity and industrial sources. The presence of toxic metals like uranium and lead raises concerns about potential health risks for residents. Further environmental sampling and health screening are urgently needed to fully characterize exposures and consequences. Remediation and prevention strategies should address the complex environmental legacy of conflict in the region. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.},

	abstract = {Bioremediation is the process of removing contaminants by biological entities such as plants and microbes. Various microbial species and plants have been studied extensively by researchers around the world for removing these xenobiotics from the environment. As advancement in the process of bioremediation, nanotechnology has been utilized in which nanoparticles synthesized by microbes and plants are employed. The advantages of nanomaterials such as higher diffusion and penetration rate than the microparticles, reactivity to redox components etc. made them advantageous in remediation. In addition to this, production of nanomaterials by biological entities further provides more advantage, making them environmentally risk free. Since nanoremediation is influenced with contaminant degradation rather than adsorption, the process was also found to be highly admissible. Bioremediation by nanoparticles has been performed in three aspects viz. synthesis of benign bionanomaterials, removal of hazardous material from the contamination site and using nanoparticles as environmental sensor for pollution control. Several nanoparticles such as TiO2, ZnO, nZVI and noble metal nanoparticles have been used successively for removal of organic contaminants. Among other nanomaterials, zero valent iron nanoparticle was found to be effective in removal of organic contaminants from soil and other contaminant sites. They were used in the degradation of pesticides, hydrocarbons, heavy metals, uranium remediation and also ground water remediation. The present chapter deals with the detailed application of nanoparticles in bioremediation of potentially harmful contaminants from the environment. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: Uranium (U), a highly deleterious radionuclide, has attracted global attention because its radiotoxicity and chemical toxicity causes severe damage to terrestrial and marine organisms. In the past few decades, numerous research has been done on immobilization, tolerance, remediation approaches and sources of U in the polluted media, and appraising the uptake and toxicity to the terrestrial plants. There are few literature reviews that elucidated the impact of soil and microbial properties on uranium immobilization and remediation methods to overcome U contamination in the natural environment. In this review, we tried to discuss biogeochemical cycling, sources, impact of soil properties on uranium immobilization and different remediation techniques involved in U treatment. Method: This review synthesized the available evidence of potential sources of Uranium, remediation techniques, and biogeochemical cycling, and further discussed the impact of soil properties on uranium immobilization based on available literature. Results: In this comprehensive review, we presented the key sources of U contamination, their occurrences, utility, and biogeochemical cycling. Moreover, the impact of U on biochemical properties and detoxification mechanisms in plants has been briefly discussed and proposed nanotechnology-based strategic engineering solutions to reduce the U in the natural environment. Conclusions: The information provided and explained in this literature review is useful for the policymakers/decision makers/environmentalists to provide serious challenges, research directions, alternative technologies and methods for recovery of U contamination in the environment.

	abstract = {The misuse of uranium is a major threat to human health and the environment. In microbial ecosystems, microbes deploy various strategies to cope with uranium-induced stress. However, the exact ecological strategies and mechanisms underlying uranium tolerance in microbes remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the survival strategies and tolerance mechanisms of microbial communities in uranium-contaminated soil and groundwater. Microbial co-occurrence networks and molecular biology techniques were used to analyze the properties of microbes in groundwater and soil samples from various depths of uranium-contaminated areas in Northwest China. Uranium pollution altered microbial ecological strategies. Uranium stress facilitated the formation of microbial community structures, leading to symbiosis. Furthermore, microbes primarily resisted uranium hazards by producing polysaccharides and phosphate groups that chelate uranium, releasing phosphate substances that precipitate uranium, and reducing U(VI) through sulfate- and iron-reducing processes. The relative abundance of metal-methylation genes in soil microorganisms positively correlated with uranium concentration, indicating that soil microorganisms can produce methyl uranium via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Furthermore, soil and groundwater microorganisms demonstrated different responses to uranium stress. This study provides new insights into microbial responses to uranium stress and novel approaches for the bioremediation of uranium-contaminated sites. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The improper disposal of uranium mine tailings and smelting wastewater poses significant environmental hazards, including contamination of water bodies and soil, and potential health risks to humans through the accumulation of uranium in bones and organs. This study examines the removal of hexavalent uranium (U(VI)) from water using biochar derived from agricultural waste enhanced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and magnetization modifications involving the incorporation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles onto the biochar surface. The adsorption capacities were evaluated through batch experiments, and the mechanisms were analyzed using SEM, FT-IR, XPS, and BET surface analysis. These modifications were found to significantly increase the biochar's specific surface area from 17.606 m2/g to 195.62 m2/g and pore volume from 0.037 cm3/g to 0.132 cm3/g, and surface enrichment with oxygen-containing functional groups, particularly carboxyl groups. The inherent adsorption efficiency of biochar for U(VI) is significantly enhanced by these modifications, with the adsorption capacities of H2O2-modified (HBC) and magnetized HBC (MBC) reaching 69.50 mg/g and 77.58 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption mechanisms of BC, HBC, and MBC for U(VI) involve complexation reactions where hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, among other oxygen-containing functional groups on the biochar, interact with uranyl ions. HBC and MBC exhibit enhanced complexation due to higher carboxyl content, leading to improved U(VI) adsorption. Additionally, the presence of iron-containing functional groups on the surface of MBC contributes to electrostatic interactions and facilitates complexation reactions between Fe-O and uranyl ions, enhancing the overall adsorption process. These findings highlight the potential of modified biochar for the removal of U(VI) from water, particularly for the treatment of mine tailings and smelting wastewater, with significant implications for industrial applications in environmental remediation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Transfer factors (TFs) are widely used tools for assessing the uptake of radionuclides by plants. The literature contains numerous studies on TFs in tropical and temperate climates; however, the existing data on TFs in arid and semi-arid climates are very scarce. Furthermore, the current trend in nuclear energy expansion in countries with this type of climate necessitates knowledge of the mechanisms of radionuclide incorporation by plants as well as the TF values. For this reason, this work investigates the TFs of 238U and 226Ra in plants in a study area during the summer period under conditions equivalent to a semi-arid climate. The selected plants were Scolymus hispanicus L., Eryngium campestre L., Chenopodium vulvaria L., and Chenopodium album L., which were collected in the vicinity of a waste dump from an abandoned copper mine. The selected study area has radionuclide levels above the global average, in addition to heavy metals, as it is a waste dump from an abandoned copper mine. The range of transfer factors for 238U varied between 1.5 × 10−4 kg−1 kg−1 and 7.8 × 10−3 kg−1 kg−1, while for 226Ra, the range was between 1.8 × 10−4 kg−1 kg−1 and 4.0 × 10−2 kg−1 kg−1. The correlations found with PCA were (i) 238U with Fe and Al, and (ii) 226Ra with S, Ti, Ca, and Sr. A transfer model of 238U and 226Ra was created using multiple linear regression analysis. The model showed how 238U was related to the presence of Al, while 226Ra was related to Al, Fe, and Ti. The results obtained have allowed us to propose a model for the incorporation of 238U and 226Ra, taking into account the chemical composition of the soil. The results obtained indicate that both Scolymus hispanicus L. and Eryngium campestre L. could be utilized in phytoremediation for soils contaminated by natural radionuclides in semi-arid climates. The TFs, as well as the proposed model, allow us to expand the knowledge of the absorption of natural radionuclides by plants in regions with arid and semi-arid climates, which is necessary for the radiological risk assessment of future nuclear fuel cycle facilities. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In this study, we used 16S high-throughput sequencing to investigate the effects of uranium mining on the rhizospheric bacterial communities and functions of three local plant species, namely, Artemisia frigida, Acorus tatarionwii Schott., and Salix oritrepha Schneid. The results showed that uranium mining significantly reduced the diversity of rhizospheric bacteria in the three local plant species, including the Shannon index and Simpson index (P < 0.05). Interestingly, we found that Sphingomonas and Pseudotrichobacter were enriched in the rhizosphere soil of the three local plants from uranium mining areas, indicating their important ecological role. The three plants were enriched in various dominant rhizospheric bacterial populations in the uranium mining area, including Vicinamidobacteriaceae, Nocardioides, and Gaiella, which may be related to the unique microecological environment of the plant rhizosphere. The rhizospheric bacterial community of A. tatarionwii plants from tailings and open-pit mines also showed a certain degree of differentiation, indicating that uranium mining is the main factor driving the differentiation of plant rhizosphere soil communities on the plateau. Functional prediction revealed that rhizospheric bacteria from different plants have developed different functions to cope with stress caused by uranium mining activities, including enhancing the translational antagonist Rof, the translation initiation factor 2B subunit, etc. This study explores for the first time the impact of plateau uranium mining activities on the rhizosphere microecology of local plants, promoting the establishment of effective soil microecological health monitoring indicators, and providing a reference for further soil pollution remediation in plateau uranium mining areas. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {The objective of the research was to examine microbial characteristics, metabolites produced, and the potential radiological risks present in mining soils located in Keana, North Central Nigeria. Soil samples were collected from various locations within Keana, Nasarawa State. Bacterial isolation was carried out, and molecular techniques were employed to characterize the bacteria found in the collected soil samples. Additionally, the susceptibility of these isolates to antibiotics was determined, and the bacteria screened for their ability to produce metabolites. The isolated bacteria were classified into three groups: Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. The analysis of the spectra revealed that 1595 compounds were produced, including carboxylic acids, nitro compounds, aldehydes, anhydrides, esters, ketones, amides, phenols, alcohols, alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and arenes. Some of the metabolites produced were oleic acid, 1,3-dioxolane, linoelaidic acid and oleic acid, 1-nonadecene, butylated hydroxytoluene, diisooctyl phthalate, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate among others, and 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid (85.32%) as the most produced metabolite. Among the antibiotics tested, levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin exhibited the strongest antibacterial properties against the isolates. Airborne gamma-ray spectrometry analysis identified elevated levels of potassium, thorium, and uranium in the soils, indicating potential environmental hazards. However, no significant correlation was found between the presence of bacteria and radioactive elements. These findings emphasize the importance of comprehensive environmental monitoring in Keana to address potential health risks associated with microbial contamination and radioactive materials. Additionally, the study highlighted the role of microbial diversity in Keana soils in promoting the production of secondary metabolites with potential applications in pharmaceutical and industrial sectors. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

Herein, 16S rRNA sequencing gene amplifiers and metagenome analysis were applied to probe microbial community structure and functional metabolism of different depth layers of covering soils in U tailings dam. Results showed that the soils were highly enriched with U (47.5–123.3 mg/kg) and a remarkable portion of 35–70% was associated with the labile fractions. It was found that U geochemical distribution was notably interacted with functional genes from N, S, Fe and P related microbes. Importantly, diminution in gene NirK and amplification in nrfH involving in nitrate reduction could induce microbial tolerance to U. Moreover, gene Sat in microbial sulfate reduction, NosZ and NorB in nitrate reduction, phnD, upgA and upgC in P transportation and phnI, phnK, phoA and opd in microbial organic P mineralization, were all closely linked to U geochemical distribution, species and cycling. All these findings disclose the functional genes that may control the transfer and transformation behavior of U in soil environment, which provides important and novel indications for the bio-remediation strategies towards U polluted sites. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The microecological effects of plateau uranium mining are still unknown. In this study, we used 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing to analyze the impact of plateau uranium mining on the microbial diversity and community structure of tailings soil, tunnel soil, and soil at different depths in an open pit. The results showed that uranium mining significantly reduced soil microbial community richness and diversity indicators, including Chao1, Pielou evenness, and Shannon index (P < 0.05). Uranium mining activities significantly reduced the abundance of RB41, Vicinamidactaceae, and Nitrospira (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the abundance of Thiobacillus, Sphingomonas, and Sulfuriferula significantly increased in the soil samples from various environments and depths during uranium mining (P < 0.05). Beta diversity analysis found that uranium mining resulted in the differentiation of soil microbial communities. Functional enrichment analysis found that uranium mining resulted in the functional enrichment of DNA binding response regulator, DNA helicase, methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein, and Helicase conserved C-terminal domain, whereas cell wall synthesis, nonspecific serine/threonine protein kinase, RNA polymerase sigma-70 factor, and ATP binding cassette transporter were significantly affected by uranium mining (P < 0.05). In addition, we also found that different uranium mining environments and soil depths enriched diverse microbial populations and functions to cope with the environmental pressures that were elicited by uranium mining, including Gaiella, Gemmatimonas, Lysobacter, Pseudomonas, signal transformation histidine kinase, DNA-directed DNA polymerase, and iron complex outer membrane receptor protein functions (P < 0.05). The results have enhanced our understanding of the impact of uranium mining on plateau soil microecological stability and the mechanism of microbial response to uranium mining activities for the first time and aided us in screening microbial strains that can promote the environmental remediation of uranium mining in plateaus. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Controlled experiment, single factor experiment and orthogonal experiment were used to study the electrokinetic optimization of uranium contaminated soil. The uranium removal efficiency increased to 55.73%, with an average leaching toxic concentration of uranium of only 0.07mol/L. After applying a composite electrolyte of 0.20mol/L tartaric acid and 0.05mol/L ferric chloride to the optimized device, the energy utilization efficiency increased to 306.21. Meanwhile, uranium mainly exists in the form of positively charged uranyl ion (UO22+) and a minor amount of neutral uranium-tartrate complex by using Visual MINTEQ software, therefore, due to the synergy of electromigration and forward electrodialysis, the migration direction of uranium is from anode to cathode. Subsequently, the experimental parameters yielding the best removal efficiency in this study were determined to be 0.15mol/L of tartaric acid, 0.08mol/L of ferric chloride, and 1.5V/cm of voltage gradient via orthogonal experiment. In addition, the modified device has the potential to improve the effect of soil remediation by ameliorating soil conductivity, zeta potential and pH levels. Moreover, when utilizing the composite liquid made up of tartaric acid and ferric chloride as the electrolyte in the modified device for repairing soil contaminated with uranium, the energy utilization and removal efficiency were elevated, and the toxicity associated with uranium leaching was substantially reduced. Therefore, an efficient and sustainable in-situ remediation technology for uranium-contaminated soil is provided. © 2023 Chinese Society for Environmental Sciences. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Shewanella putrefaciens (S. putrefaciens) is one of the main microorganisms in soil bioreactors, which mainly immobilizes uranium through reduction and mineralization processes. However, the effects of elements such as phosphorus and ZVI, which may be present in the actual environment, on the mineralization and reduction processes are still not clearly understood and the environment is mostly in the absence of oxygen. In this study, we ensure that all experiments are performed in an anaerobic glove box, and we elucidate through a combination of macroscopic experimental findings and microscopic characterization that the presence of inorganic phosphates enhances the mineralization of uranyl ions on the surface of S. putrefaciens, while zero-valent iron (ZVI) facilitates the immobilization of uranium by promoting the reduction of uranium by S. putrefaciens. Interestingly, when inorganic phosphates and ZVI co-exist, both the mineralization and reduction of uranium on the bacterial surface are simultaneously enhanced. However, these two substances exhibit a certain degree of antagonism in terms of uranium immobilization by S. putrefaciens. Furthermore, it is found that the influence of pH on the mineralization and reduction of uranyl ions is far more significant than that of inorganic phosphates and ZVI. This study contributes to a better understanding of the environmental fate of uranium in real-world settings and provides valuable theoretical support for the bioremediation and risk assessment of uranium contamination. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The addition of soil amendments to facilitate plant-based remediation of soil contaminated with radioactive nuclides is considered a promising approach. Here, we tested different levels of biochar to help clean uranium-contaminated soil in the potted plants. Adding 1% biochar had the best results in deactivating uranium, increasing soil enzyme activity, and promoting ryegrass growth. Microbiological and metabolomic analysis further revealed that 1 wt % biochar significantly enhanced the abundance of microorganisms such as Actinobacteriota and Myxococcota and accelerated the production of differential metabolites such as lipids and lipid-like molecules, organic acids and derivatives, and organic oxygen compounds. The analysis of biological and nonbiological interaction networks indicates that the coordinated interaction between bacteria, enzymes, and metabolites significantly improves the expression level of the ABC transporter’s metabolic pathway. This enhances the resistance of living cells to uranium and maintains system homeostasis under uranium stress.

It can efficiently adsorb hexavalent uranium with an adsorption ratio of 92.3%. The influence of different environmental conditions on the adsorption ratio of Chryseobacterium bernardetii strain WK-3 was investigated, and the adsorption mechanism was preliminarily discussed by scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM–EDS). The results showed that the optimal adsorption conditions for U(VI) by Chryseobacterium bernardetii strain WK-3 were pH = 5, temperature 30 ℃, NaCl concentration 1%, and inoculation volume 10%. When the initial concentration of U was 50 ~ 150 mg/L, the adsorption capacity of Chryseobacterium bernardetii strain WK-3 to U(VI) reached the maximum and maintained the equilibrium at 44 h. SEM–EDS results showed that phosphorus in cells participates in the interaction of uranyl ions, which may indicate that phosphate was produced during cell metabolism and was further combined to form U(VI)-phosphate minerals. In summary, Chryseobacterium bernardetii strain WK-3 would be a promising alternative for environmental uranium contamination remediation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

The long-lived actinides (e.g. 237Np, 2.14 million year half-life) are particularly challenging, and pose multigenerational technical and policy issues for the remediation of contaminated land and the disposal of radioactive wastes. Over the last decade, increasing evidence indicates that actinides may substitute for Fe in the structure of iron (oxyhydr)oxides. Given the thermodynamic stability of iron (oxyhydr)oxides over the crustal continuum, incorporation may provide long-term immobilisation pathways for anthropogenic actinide contaminants. Here, the speciation and coordination adopted by key actinides (i.e. U, Np, Pu and Am) on incorporation into iron (oxyhydr)oxides is reviewed.

	abstract = {Containing only low levels of U-bearing minerals, U ores often have to undergo hydrometallurgical processing for the separation of other minerals. Hydrometallurgical operations, even after being shut down, could pose radiological risk to the ecosystem and human health due to the radionuclide contamination of surrounding environmental media. This study investigated the contamination of radionuclides in the agricultural topsoils downstream of a decommissioned hydrometallurgical U plant in southern China, and assessed the corresponding radiological risk and evaluated its impact on soil microbial communities. The values of geoaccumulation index and potential ecological risk index indicate that all soil samples were significantly contaminated with U and 226Ra, with their concentrations being 4.4–28.7 times and 4.4–114.8 times higher than the corresponding regional background values, respectively. The mean outdoor annual effective dose (OAED) in the sampling plot next to the drainage ditch downstream of the decommissioned plant was up to 3.9 and 8.2 times higher than the Chinese annual effective dose limit and global average, respectively, which is indicative of unacceptable radiological risk for the local farm workers. Soil microbial composition was obviously impacted by the soil physicochemical properties and radionuclides. Specifically, Cladophialophora, which belongs to the fungal genus, exhibited significantly positive correlations with the contents of total Cd, total U, organic U, residual U, and total K, while Methanosarcina, which belongs to the archaeal genus, exhibited significantly positive correlations with the contents of 226Ra and residual U. Soil pH and total N content were significantly correlated with the abundance of several bacterial genera and the dominant archaeal genus (i.e., Candidatus Nitrocosmicus). These findings demonstrate the existence of potentially significant radiological risk associated with the radionuclides released from historical hydrometallurgical processing of U ores to the surrounding environment, and the need for proper site management and remediation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Uranium in its natural state is composed of three distinct isotopes: 238, 235, and 234U. This heavy metal has a substantial level of chemical toxicity for biota. It transports radioactivity from the earth into the indoor environment, raising the risk of lung cancer. Its uptake by plants can result in cellular damage and disruption of cellular homeostasis and its regulation. The pH of the environment and the presence of complex ligands are two factors that affect the chemical speciation of uranium in the environment. This chemical speciation determines the destiny, transportation, bioavailability, and dangerous potential of uranium. Both bioavailability and toxicity are extremely sensitive to how an individual is exposed to them. In this chapter, we will focus on and review various sources of uranium as well as its speciation, absorption, toxic effects, and biological remediation techniques in soil-plant systems. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Mechanochemistry is a synthetic approach that utilises mechanical forces, such as grinding, shearing and friction, to initiate or sustain chemical reactions. Mechanochemical synthesis has been widely explored in pharmaceutical materials, nanoparticles, MOFs, and battery materials studies. Due to its solventless nature, scalability and low energy consumption mechanochemistry has found applications in recycling valuable materials, such as polymers [1] and electronic waste[2]. Notably, researchers have investigated mechanochemistry as a greener alternative for remediating contaminated soil as it can be easily scaled up [3]. Our project focuses on applying mechanochemical methods to address potentially toxic elements specifically uranium (U) and arsenic (As), in mine tailings. Currently, remediating arsenic involves energy-intensive high-temperature processes or liquid extraction methods that generate additional environmentally harmful waste streams. Meanwhile, the waste resulted from uranium ore processing is typically stored in tailing dams or settling ponds as slurry, without effective long-term remediation processes on a large scale. Our novel approach aims to fill this gap. Our project targets the mechanochemical synthesis of meta-zeunerite (MZ), a stable, secondary uranium and arsenic mineral with the formula [Cu(UO2)2(AsO4)2·8H2O]. MZ has been discovered near an abandoned uranium mine in South Terras, Cornwall, UK. Studies have shown that MZ can be used to precipitate uranium and arsenic from groundwater due to its low solubility and high stability [4]. Successfully synthesising MZ using mechanochemical methods could offer a promising approach for remediating uranium and arsenic in soil and mine tailings. In our poster presentation, we demonstrate the mechanochemical synthesis of MZ using uranyl nitrate hexahydrate [(UO2(NO3)2·6H2O)] and copper nitrate trihydrate [Cu(NO3)2·3H2O], along with arsenic pentoxide (As2O5), arsenic trioxide (As2O3), or an arsenic waste sample. We fully characterised the synthetic samples using X-ray Powder Diffraction, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy. Results indicate that MZ is the main phase when As2O5 is used as the arsenic source. When replaced with As2O3, only the reagents are observed in the product. To address this, we introduced solid oxidants such as sodium chlorite (NaClO2) and calcium hypochlorite [Ca(ClO)2], which facilitated the oxidation of As(III) to As(V) and led to the appearance of MZ. Additionally, we successfully synthesised MZ using arsenic tailings containing 67w% As2O3, validating the feasibility of our approach. Beyond MZ, our research explores the mechanochemical formation of other arsenate salts, including Fe-arsenate, Cuarsenate, and Ca-arsenate.

	abstract = {Uranium in soil can exist in both (IV) and (VI) oxidation states, distributed among different soil fractions (exchangeable, carbonate, oxidizable, reducible, and residual). Following its release from these fractions, uranium enters the soil pore water, becoming bioavailable and potentially posing risks due to its radio and chemical toxicity. Given the significant health and environmental risks associated with uranium, it is crucial to understand its behaviour in contaminated soil pore water and how it changes over time, especially in response to seasonal variations. To address this issue, study was designed to investigate the temporal changes in uranium availability in soil pore water, with a special focus on effect of seasonal variations and biogeochemical reactions that govern the bioavailability of uranium in a contaminated soil mesocosm. This field investigation was carried out for two consecutive years, and revealed that, seasonal variation has a significant effect on the bioavailability of the uranium in the upper soil layers (<30 cm). The biogenic NO3− induced oxidative dissolution of uranium was found to be the predominant reaction causing the dissolution of uranium into soil pore water, followed by ion-exchange in upper layer, whereas at higher depths (30 cm < d < 70 cm) bioavailability is predominantly controlled by ion-exchange reaction. Furthermore, the study shows that at upper layers bioavailability is high during the summer, which is attributed to higher rate of biogenic denitrification and ion exchange reactions. Fast vertical migration of uranium in the soil column is attributed to formation of stable mobile species such as hydroxo‑carbonato ((UO2)xCO3(OH)y−), hydroxo (UO2)x(OH)y and carbonato (UO2CO3) complexes, identified by speciation modelling. For the first time, this study reports the process controlling uranium behaviour in soil pore water and the effect of seasonal variation on it in a contaminated soil. The findings are essential for assessing its potential radiological impact and remediation planning. © 2023},

	abstract = {The influence of uranium (U) mining on the fungal diversity (FD) and communities (FC) structure was investigated in this work. Our results revealed that soil FC richness and FD indicators obviously decreased due to U, such as Chao1, observed OTUs and Shannon index (P<0.05). Moreover, the abundances of Mortierella, Gibberella, and Tetracladium were notably reduced in soil samples owing to U mining activities (P<0.05). In contrast, the abundances of Cadophora, Pseudogymnoascus, Mucor, and Sporormiella increased in all soil samples after U mining (P<0.05). Furthermore, U mining not only dramatically influenced the Plant_Pathogen guild and Saprotroph and Pathotroph modes (P<0.05), but also induced the differentiation of soil FC and the enrichment of the Animal_Pathogen-Soil_Saprotroph and Endophyte guilds and Symbiotroph and Pathotroph Saprotroph trophic modes. In addition, various fungal populations and guilds were enriched to deal with the external stresses caused by U mining in different U mining areas and soil depths (P<0.05). Finally, nine U-tolerant fungi were isolated and identified with a minimum inhibitory concentration range of 400–600 mg/L, and their adsorption efficiency for U ranged from 11.6% to 37.9%. This study provides insights into the impact of U mining on soil fungal stability and the response of fungi to U mining activities, as well as aids in the screening of fungal strains that can be used to promote remediation of U mining sites on plateaus. © 2024 The Authors},

In comparison to Deino-wt and control group, the Deino-ure exhibited a decrease in leached uranium (VI) content, an increase in total soil uranium content, yielding a uranium retention rate of 60.98%. The equilibrium enrichment capacity was 53 mg/g, which was consistent with the pseudo-first-order reaction kinetic model (correlation coefficient R2 = 0.99792). This validates the impact of Deino-ure on the forms of uranium in soil, demonstrating a transformation of the free state uranium into less migratory forms.

	abstract = {Streptomyces are important soil bacteria used for bioremediation of metal-contaminated soils, however, it is still unknown how metal-selective Streptomyces are and which mechanisms are involved during their capture. In this work, we exposed S. coelicolor spores to environmentally relevant concentrations (0.1, 1, 10, 100 μM) of Ce, U and Cd in solid medium for one week to investigate the uptake behaviour of hyphae in the newly formed spores. Additionally, metal adsorption onto the spores was explored by incubating inactive, ungerminated spores for one day in aqueous metal solution. The spore-washing treatment was key to distinguishing between strongly spore-associated (e.g. incorporation; Tris-EDTA buffer) and weakly spore-associated metals (Tris buffer alone minus Tris-EDTA). Single cell (sc) ICP-MS was used to quantify metal-associated content in individual spores. Our results revealed element-specific adsorption onto inactive spores showing that out of the total metal exposure, both strongly (Ce: 58%; U: 54%; Cd: 28%) and weakly (Ce: 12%; U: 1%; Cd: 18%) adsorbed metals occur. However, scICP-MS showed that from metal-amended solid medium, only Ce and U were strongly spore-associated (averages 0.040 and 0.062 fg spore−1 for 10 μM exposures, respectively) while Cd was below the limit of detection (< 0.006 fg spore−1). We propose that hyphae only metabolically interact with Ce in a controlled manner but uncontrolled with U, as 66–73% Ce and only 2–4% U were inherited from adsorbed content. We conclude that Streptomyces spore-metal interaction starts with a relevant adsorption step of Ce, U and Cd as presented for aqueous conditions. If spores start to germinate, hyphae are capable of effectively encapsulating Ce and U, but not Cd. This study brings light into the still unknown field of metal interactions with Streptomyces and applied understanding for more efficient and metal-specific use of Streptomyces in bioremediation of metal-polluted soils. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Several anthropogenic activities produce radioactive materials into the environment. According to reports, exposure to high concentrations of radioactive elements such as potassium (40K), uranium (238U and 235U), and thorium (232Th) poses serious health concerns. The scarcity of reviews addressing the occurrence/sources, distribution, and remedial solutions of radioactive contamination in the ecosystems has fueled data collection for this bibliometric survey. In rivers and potable water, reports show that several parts of Europe and Asia have recorded radionuclide concentrations much higher than the permissible level of 1 Bq/L. According to various investigations, activity concentrations of gamma-emitting radioactive elements discovered in soils are higher than the global average crustal values, especially around mining activities. Adsorption technique is the most prevalent remedial method for decontaminating radiochemically polluted sites. However, there is a need to investigate integrated approaches/combination techniques. Although complete radionuclide decontamination utilizing the various technologies is feasible, future research should focus on cost-effectiveness, waste minimization, sustainability, and rapid radionuclide decontamination. Radioactive materials can be harnessed as fuel for nuclear power generation to meet worldwide energy demand. However, proper infrastructure must be put in place to prevent catastrophic disasters. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

The residual N2H4 was precipitated when the pH was adjusted using sulfuric acid (H2SO4) to recycle the wastewater in the soil-washing process.

	abstract = {Radionuclides released from nuclear contamination harm the environment and human health. Nuclear pollution spread over large areas and the costs associated with decontamination is high. Traditional remediation methods include both chemical and physical, however, these are expensive and unsuitable for large-scale restoration. Bioremediation is the use of plants or microorganisms to remove pollutants from the environment having a lower cost and can be upscaled to eliminate contamination from soil, water and air. It is a cheap, efficient, ecologically, and friendly restoration technology. Here we review the sources of radionuclides, bioremediation methods, mechanisms of plant resistance to radionuclides and the effects on the efficiency of biological adsorption. Uptake of radionuclides by plants can be facilitated by the addition of appropriate chemical accelerators and agronomic management, such as citric acid and intercropping. Future research should accelerate the use of genetic engineering and breeding techniques to screen high-enrichment plants. In addition, field experiments should be carried out to ensure that this technology can be applied to the remediation of nuclear contaminated sites as soon as possible. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Pot experiments were conducted to study the effects of the addition of Bacillus subtilis, Gillus niger, and Mortierella alpina (0, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mL; bacterial concentrations were 0, 2 × 105, 4 × 105, 8 × 105, and 1.6 × 106 CFU/g) on the growth characteristics, enrichment and transfer ability to uranium and thorium, physical and chemical properties of the rhizosphere, and the distribution of uranium and thorium in Lolium perenne. The results showed that addition of a small amount of B. subtilis (5 mL) significantly promoted L. perenne L growth, greatly enhanced uranium and thorium enrichment and transfer ability in L. perenne, and substantially boosted the proportion of exchangeable uranium and thorium in the soil. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results showed that the addition of a small amount of B. subtilis (5 mL) promoted the synthesis of amino-, carboxyl-, and methyl groups in plants, as well as the combination of carboxyl groups with metal ions such as U and Th in plants. This promoted plant growth, absorption, and enrichment of uranium and thorium, consistent with the growth, absorption, and transfer of uranium and thorium in L. perenne. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X ray spectroscopy (EDS) results showed that uranium and thorium were uniformly distributed in L. perenne when 5 mL B. subtilis or 10 mL Aspergillus niger was added. No additional reagents were used in this experiment except for the strain to establish a sustainable, low-carbon, accessible, and reliable approach for the treatment of radioactively contaminated soil. Adding B. subtilis at a concentration of 2 × 105 CFU/g to the soil significantly improved the enrichment ability of uranium and thorium nuclides and enhanced the soil remediation effect. © 2024 Science Press.

	abstract = {Phosphogypsum (PG) is a solid by-product of the phosphate industry, rich in contaminants and produced in large quantities. Raw materials and stabilized specimens, consisting of bentonite-lime-PG mixtures, were characterized by mineralogical, microstructural, chemical, alpha-particle, and gamma-ray spectrometry analysis before hydration and after hardening. Compressive strength and leaching tests were performed on hardened specimens. The physicochemical parameters and chemical composition of leachates from raw materials and hardened specimens were determined. PG contains high concentrations of natural radionuclides, specially from U series. Uranium-238 activities are double in PG than the worldwide average for soil values. The mobility of PTEs from PG is Cd (2.43%), Zn (2.36%), Ni (2.07%), Cu (1.04%), Pb (0.25%), and As (0.21%). Cadmium is the cation most easily released by PG in water with a concentration 0.0316 mg kg−1. When PG is added to bentonite-lime mixture, cadmium is no longer released. The radionuclide 238,234U and 210Po predominates in the leachates of PG. However, the activity of 210Po becomes negligible in the leachates of bentonite-lime-PG mixtures. The addition of PG to bentonite-lime mixtures facilitates the trapping of trace elements (PTEs) and radionuclides, providing potential applications for PG as road embankments and fill coatings.

	abstract = {The dynamic reactions of uranium (U) with iron (Fe) minerals change its behaviors in soil environment, however, how the coexisted constituents in soil affect U sequestration and release on Fe minerals during the transformation remains unclear. Herein, coupled effects of lead (Pb) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) on U speciation and release kinetics during the catalytic transformations of ferrihydrite (Fh) by Fe(II) were investigated. Our results revealed that the coexistence of Pb and DOM significantly reduced U release and increased the immobilization of U during Fh transformation, which were attributed to the enhanced inhibition of Fh transformation, the declined release of DOM and the increased U(VI) reduction. Specifically, the presence of Pb increased the coprecipitation of condensed aromatics, polyphenols and phenols, and these molecules were preferentially maintained by Fe (oxyhydr)oxides. The sequestrated polyphenols and phenols could further facilitate U(VI) reduction to U(IV). Additionally, a higher Pb content in coprecipitates caused a slower U release, especially when DOM was present. Compared with Pb, the concentrations of the released U were significantly lower during the transformation. Our results contribute to predicting U sequestration and remediating U-contaminated soils. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Acid leaching has been widely applied to treat contaminated soil, however, it contains several inorganic pollutants. The decommissioning of nuclear power plants introduces radioactive and soluble U(VI), a substance posing chemical toxicity to humans. Our investigation sought to ascertain the efficacy of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), an highly efficient adsorbent, in treating U(VI) in wastewater. The adsorption equilibrium of U(VI) by h-BN reached saturation within a mere 2 h. The adsorption of U(VI) by h-BN appears to be facilitated through electrostatic attraction, as evidenced by the observed impact of pH variations, acidic agents (i.e., HCl or H2SO4), and the presence of background ions on the adsorption performance. A reusability test demonstrated the successful completion of five cycles of adsorption/desorption, relying on the surface characteristics of h-BN as influenced by solution pH. Based on the experimental variables of initial U(VI) concentration, exposure time, temperature, pH, and the presence of background ions/organic matter, a feature importance analysis using random forest (RF) was carried out to evaluate the correlation between performances and conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to conduct the adsorption of U(VI) generated from real contaminated soil by h-BN, followed by interpretation of the correlation between performance and conditions using RF. Lastly, a. plausible adsorption mechanism between U(VI) and h-BN was explained based on the experimental results, characterizations, and a. comparison with previous adsorption studies on the removal of heavy metals by h-BN. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Uranium-stressed soil caused by nuclear industry development and energy acquisition have attracted extensive attentions for a long time. This study investigated the effects of biochar application with different pyrolysis temperatures (300 ℃, 500 ℃ and 700 ℃) on remediation of uranium-stressed soil. The results showed that higher pyrolysis temperature (700 ℃) was benefit for ryegrass growing and caused a lower uranium accumulation in plants. At the same time, uranium immobilization was more effective at higher biochar pyrolysis temperature. Careful investigations indicated that activities of soil urease and sucrase were promoted, and bacterial diversity was strengthened in C700 group, which may contribute to uranium immobilization. The biochar application could activate metabolic of lipids and amino acids, organic acids and derivatives, and organic oxygen compounds. Nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, and Benzoxazinoid biosynthesis were unique metabolic pathways in the C700 group, which could enhance the uranium tolerance from different perspectives. Based on these results, we recommend to use biochar with 700 °C pyrolysis temperature when processing remediation of uranium-stressed soil.

	abstract = {Soil contamination by uranium presents a burgeoning global environmental concern, exerting detrimental effects on both agricultural production and soil health. Biochar, a carbonaceous material derived from biomass pyrolysis, exhibits considerable potential for remediating uranium-contaminated soils. However, a comprehensive review of the effects of biochar on the fate and accumulation of uranium in soil–plant systems remains conspicuously absent. In this paper, uranium sources and contamination are reviewed, and the impact of biochar on uranium immobilization and detoxification in soil–plant systems is analyzed. We reviewed the status of uranium contamination in soils globally and found that mining activities are currently the main sources. Further meta-analysis revealed that biochar addition significantly reduced the soil uranium bioavailability and shoot uranium accumulation, and their effect value is 58.9% (40.8–76.8%) and 39.7% (15.7–63.8%), respectively. Additionally, biochar enhances the soil microenvironment, providing favourable conditions for promoting plant growth and reducing uranium mobility. We focused on the mechanisms governing the interaction between biochar and uranium, emphasising the considerable roles played by surface complexation, reduction, ion exchange, and physical adsorption. The modification of biochar by intensifying these mechanisms can promote uranium immobilisation in soils. Finally, biochar alleviates oxidative stress and reduces uranium accumulation in plant tissues, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of uranium on plant growth and development. Overall, our review highlights the capacity of biochar to remediate uranium contamination in soil–plant systems through diverse mechanisms, providing valuable insights for sustainable environmental remediation. Highlights Biochar reduces uranium mobility through a variety of mechanisms, including surface complexation, reduction, ion exchange, and physical adsorption. Biochar significantly reduces uranium bioavailability in soil and limits its accumulation in plants. Modified biochar has been shown to enhance its effectiveness in immobilising uranium. Biochar application to soil not only promotes uranium remediation but also improves soil quality. Graphical Abstract: (Figure presented.) © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {In this work, radioactivity investigations of soil samples from neutral and agricultural sites in Punjab (India) have been carried out to study the impact of land use patterns. Analyzing soil samples radiological, mineralogical, and physicochemical attributes has employed state-of-the-art techniques. The mean activity concentration of 238U/226Ra, 232Th, 40K, 235U, and 137Cs, measured using a carbon fiber endcap p-type HPGe detector, in neutral land was observed as 58.03, 83.95, 445.18, 2.83, and 1.16 Bq kg−1, respectively. However, in vegetation land, it was found to be 40.07, 64.68, 596.74, 2.26, and 1.90 Bq kg−1, respectively. In the detailed activity analysis, radium equivalent (Raeq) radioactivity is in the safe prescribed limit of 370 Bq kg−1 for all investigated soil samples. However, the dosimetric investigations revealed that the outdoor absorbed gamma dose rate (96.08 nGy h−1) and consequent annual effective dose rate (0.12 mSv y−1) for neutral land and the gamma dose rate (82.46 nGy h−1) and subsequent annual effective dose rate (0.10 mSv y−1) for vegetation land marginally exceeded the global average. The soil’s physicochemical parameters (pH, EC, and porosity) from both sites were measured, and their correlations with radionuclides were analyzed. Various heavy metals of health concern, namely, chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn), were also evaluated in soil samples using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Pollution Load Index (PLI) and Ecological Risk Index (RI) revealed that vegetation land was more anthropogenically contaminated than neutral land, with maximum contamination from Hg and As. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {[Background] The remediation technology for U(VI), Ca2+ and other pollutants in the groundwater of the mining area of in-situ leaching of uranium has become a key technical bottleneck restricting the decommission of uranium mine, and the microbial-induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) technology can well mineralize and remove heavy metals in the groundwater. [Purpose] This study aims to remove the pollutants in groundwater of uranium mining areas with MICP. [Methods] First of all, bacillus pasteurianus was selected, and its acid resistance and tolerance to uranium were analyzed. Then, the effects of initial U(VI) concentration, initial Ca2+ concentration, initial pH value, concentration of bacterial solution, and the time of mineralization on the removal of pollutants by MICP were explored. In addition, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) were employed to characterize the composition and microstructure of the mineralization products of MICP, in order to reveal the mechanism of mineralization and decontamination. Finally, water with low uranium concentration was treated by bacillus pasteurianus to verify the application of MICP. [Results] The results show that Bartonella pasteurii has good urease activity at pH value of 4 and can adapt to the groundwater containing U(VI) concentration of 100 mg∙L−1. When the initial pH value is 4, the initial uranium concentration is 50 mg∙L−1, the Ca2+ concentration is 8 000 mg ∙ L−1, and the time of mineralization by MICP is 48 h, the removal rates of U(VI) and Ca2+ in the groundwater are 61% and 54%, respectively. The removal rate of U(VI) further increases to 91% when the initial pH value is increased to 7. Meanwhile, the increase of Ca2+ concentration promotes the removal of U(VI) in groundwater by MICP, however, the removal rate of Ca2+ is relatively low if the concentration of Ca2+ is too high. [Conclusions] The composition of MICP mineralization products is mainly uranium-containing calcium carbonate, in which the uranium is immobilized mainly by co-precipitation. Therefore, Bacillus pasteurianus can well remove U(VI) and Ca2+ in the groundwater of the mining area of in-situ leaching of uranium, and has a good prospect of application. © 2024 Science Press.

One important radiological impact of these wastes is the release of radon into the atmosphere. Therefore, the prediction/evaluation of radon flux and the effectiveness of different covers are the major elements in radiation protection, long-term safety aspects, and the modeling of radon release into the environment for a final assessment of radiological impacts and required remediation actions. A measurement system has been designed based on the transient-diffusion method to evaluate radon exhalation by the short-time accumulation technique. The validity of the laboratory model to quickly estimate the radon release from soils, the diffusion coefficient, and the effect of covers was investigated. From the results obtained from the experimental model, it was observed that after a 0.5-m(1-m) cover layer, the radon flux reduction factor increases from 1.3(2.1) for sand to about 2(3) for clay. The results show that the effectiveness of the cover layer studied is 3, which is similar to theoretical and experimental results in uranium tailings ponds. © 2024 American Nuclear Society.},

Radionuclides are well known potent carcinogens that may cause the various types of cancers to human and animals due to the long exposure to radioactive contaminated sites. To get rid of from the radioactive pollution there is a need of practically successful and cost effective bioremediation technologies that should able to decontaminate the effected lands and water to benefit the mankind.

	abstract = {Nano-zero-valent iron (nZVI, < 100 nm) has been used extensively in groundwater remediation over the past two decades. In this review, recent research (past 5–6 years) were discussed and evaluated. (1) nZVI could already be prepared by top-down and bottom-up methods. Liquid-phase reduction and carbothermal reduction still possessed a high proportion. Ball milling and green synthesis were more promising pathways. Carbothermal reduction was cost-effective compared to other paths. In-situ green synthesis was expected to in-situ synthesis nZVI, providing new ideas for groundwater remediation. (2) Composites and modification could improve the applicability and lower storage requirements of nZVI to a certain extent. Recyclability was effectively enhanced and costs indirectly reduced (5 cycles test). The suitability of habitats should be considered. Natural minerals and/or its component carriers finally acted as mineral cover layer. Carbon materials and biopolymer coatings eventually served as microbial nutrients. They were all potential directions. (3) In-situ groundwater remediation could maximize the value of nZVI. Mobility and stability of nZVI should be further optimized. So as to completely purified argillaceous soil and aquifer matrix. Geological properties, biological population, and hydrochemical aging all influenced groundwater remediation. Batch injection could avert rebound issue (usually two injections, spaced several months apart). DC electric field–assisted obviously reduced the cost (5 times). (4) nZVI removed pollutants in aqueous matrix (purified water, surface water, groundwater) through various ways and mechanisms. Hydrodynamic and hydrochemical conditions could not change the mainstream process. Long-term fixation of heavy metals, reasonable removal of inorganic salt ions, and effective mineralization of organic substances were the most expected results. The macro-to-micro study of mechanisms was more in-need. This review will offer fresh perspectives on the use of nZVI in groundwater remediation. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Pollution of the environment with heavy metals, metalloids, and radionuclides is a global problem that seriously affects the state of the biosphere. In particular, chromium compounds have toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic effects. The main principle of purification of anthropogenic and natural ecosystems from chromates is the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), whose salts are significantly less toxic and insoluble. However, currently used electrochemical and ion-exchange purification methods are quite expensive and require the use of special reagents. At the same time, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are of particular interest for bioremediation of this kind, since many of them are very resistant to high concentrations of heavy metals and are able to effectively reduce them in the presence of hydrogen as an electron donor. This review summarizes the known data on the interaction of heavy metals, metalloids, and radionuclides with SRB. The features of the metabolism of these microorganisms that lead to intracellular accumulations of heavy metals and metalloids are considered. Complex and finely regulated enzymatic mechanisms for the reduction of toxic metals (using various cytochromes, hydrogenases, oxidoreductases, highly specific metal reductases, and the thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase systems), as well as the possibility of using immobilized cells and biofilms of SRB in the effective bioremediation of natural waters, soils, and industrial effluents, are described. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.},

As a gas, radon is an element produced due to uranium decay; it emanates naturally from soil and is considered by the World Health Organization as the second most common cause of lung cancer. Several methodologies are available for mitigating the indoor radon concentration, with distinct improvements and efficiencies that need to be proved with on-site testing. The case study here presented analyzes the effect of applying a barrier membrane, covering the pavement of a ground floor room located in a historic building with a high occupancy rate, on an abnormal radon concentration evidenced by experimental data. After the barrier membrane installation, a new long-term monitoring campaign (3 months) was carried out to assess indoor radon concentration. The obtained results showed that the barrier membrane lowered the indoor radon concentration by 90%. However, the radon exposure level remained higher than the recommended level to enable safe occupation and the regular use of space. Nevertheless, as the reduction in the radon concentration was very significant by the adoption of a barrier membrane, the combination of this technical solution with other mitigation methodologies, namely including the adoption of mechanical ventilation procedures, can become a very efficient solution for radon remediation, reducing the number of air changes per hour (ACH) from 30–60 to 4–6. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Soil contamination by heavy metals poses major risks to human health and the environment. Given the current status of heavy metal pollution, many remediation techniques have been tested at laboratory and contaminated sites. The effects of soil organic matter-mediated electron transfer on heavy metal remediation have not been adequately studied, and the key mechanisms underlying this process have not yet been elucidated. In this review, microbial extracellular electron transfer pathways, organic matter electron transfer for heavy metal reduction, and the factors affecting these processes were discussed to enhance our understanding of heavy metal pollution. It was found that microbial extracellular electrons delivered by electron shuttles have the longest distance among the three electron transfer pathways, and the application of exogenous electron shuttles lays the foundation for efficient and persistent remediation of heavy metals. The organic matter-mediated electron transfer process, wherein organic matter acts as an electron shuttle, promotes the conversion of high valence state metal ions, such as Cr(VI), Hg(II), and U(VI), into less toxic and morphologically stable forms, which inhibits their mobility and bioavailability. Soil type, organic matter structural and content, heavy metal concentrations, and environmental factors (e.g., pH, redox potential, oxygen conditions, and temperature) all influence organic matter-mediated electron transfer processes and bioremediation of heavy metals. Organic matter can more effectively mediate electron transfer for heavy metal remediation under anaerobic conditions, as well as when the heavy metal content is low and the redox potential is suitable under fluvo-aquic/paddy soil conditions. Organic matter with high aromaticity, quinone groups, and phenol groups has a stronger electron transfer ability. This review provides new insights into the control and management of soil contamination and heavy metal remediation technologies. © 2024},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the soil and material activation resulting from the operation of a small transportable reactor featuring finely tuned internal shielding to meet weight restrictions. In contrast to existing research that primarily centers on nuclear weapon effects, this study delves into the activation potential of reactor operation. Utilizing the SCALE modeling software, we evaluate soil and rock activation levels resulting from a 1 MWth reactor operating without external shielding or structure for one year. A comprehensive range of common substrates, including soils, rocks, and various concrete types, is examined. Activation characteristics for each type are considered and compared by substrate type and contributing elements. Our findings reveal that, in most of our substrate samples, long-term radioactivity is primarily driven by high concentrations of Iron (Fe), Calcium (Ca), and Manganese (Mn). This was due to the relatively high weight percentages in the soil and their relative high merit based upon their respective half-lives, isotopic abundances, and cross sections. The dose contribution due to trace elements, < .01% or weight abundance, was characterized and its impact on the total dose was found to be minimal. This trace element analyzed a small population of trace elements and further study is warranted, particularly looking at Cobalt, Uranium, Thorium and Europium. The results presented in this paper can serve as general guidelines for potential site selection and may provide insights for reactor design and shielding. However, practical applications necessitate a site-specific survey to ensure accurate results, given the significant variance in weight percentages within a given substrate. Additionally, a near-field dose analysis conducted after the reactor's removal from the site indicates that the activated soil will moderately exceed acceptable levels for several years with the current design. This analysis involved a voxel-by-voxel assessment within a purpose-built Python utility, examining both activation and corresponding emissions over a wide area and across multiple solid depths. While geometric activation and distance analyses of this nature are not commonly performed within SCALE, refinements for such analyses in similar problem sets are recommended. © ICAPP 2024.All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Depleted uranium (DU) from corroded armor penetrators can migrate through the soil vadose zone and cause environmental problems, yet studies on such migration at former theatres of war are scarce. Here, we investigated vertical DU migration in a soil profile due to a penetrator (3–8 cm beneath the soil surface) corroded over 7 years in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The highest concentration of DU was ∼45,300 mg/kg at 6–10 cm, with the concentration decreasing markedly with increasing depth. The majority of the DU accumulated within the top 20 cm and the DU front reached ∼42 cm beneath the penetrator. In addition, particles with varying U concentrations (3–65 wt%) were observed at 0–15 cm, with U primarily co-located with O, Si, Al, maghemite, and hematite. Particularly, metaschoepite was identified at 6–10 cm. Finally, X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis found U was hexavalent in the soil profile. These findings suggest that the downward migration of DU was likely present as a soluble form adsorbed on clay minerals and Fe oxides. Overall, we show that the rate of DU migration within the vadose zone is comparatively slow, although if the penetrator is left in the soil for decades, it could pose a serious long-term risk. Environmental Implications: Over 90 % of the depleted uranium (DU) penetrators fired in previous conflicts missed their armored targets and were left in the soil to corrode. The corroded penetrators can not only contaminate soil but also pose a risk to groundwater. The present study examined the migration of DU in a soil profile that included a DU penetrator that had been corroding for over 7 years. Studying the dynamics of DU migration is essential to develop effective remediation strategies to mitigate long-term environmental risks and safeguard ecosystems and human health from DU contamination. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This study investigated, from practical and engineering perspectives, a systematic design and its ability to remediate real U-contaminated soil, with the aim of assessing the performance of a zero liquid discharge system for treating wastewater from a soil-washing process. Specifically, we carried out a purification process for U-contaminated soil and its wastewater; the proposed method consisted of U(VI) precipitation, solid–liquid separation with a filter-press, and distillation of the filtrate on the basis of U(VI) concentration. Experimental results indicated complete separation of uranium from the contaminated soil. Self-disposal of the treated soil was possible because it contained uranium at a concentration less than 1.0 Bq·g−1, which the International Atomic Energy Agency has suggested as the clearance level for radionuclides. In terms of the zero liquid discharge system, the distillation process enabled not only water reuse of the filtrate after solid–liquid separation but also self-disposal of high-purity Na2SO4 in the residues of the distilled filtrate. According to a comparison of the economic analysis between direct disposal and the application of a remediation process to treat U-contaminated soil, the proposed comprehensive zero liquid discharge system for the treatment of U-contaminated soil is a practical and feasible option. We anticipate that the valuable experimental results and implications in this study will play a significant role in both academia and industry given the demonstration of design and applicability of the proposed zero liquid discharge system to treat wastewater generated from real U-contaminated soil. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Excessive deflection of a rail in response to axle loading can lead to discomfort for passengers and increased wear of both railway structures and trains. These oscillations are often caused by poor trackbed stiffness which may be due to either soft subgrade and/or contaminated ballast. A variety of trackbed stabilisation (TBS) techniques are available to remediate soft subgrades and increase the safety of tracks within the railway network. Traditional TBS methods require track removal, which is expensive, disruptive and often inefficient maintenance works. Micro-piling, using screw piles installed between sleepers, is an innovative low disruption TBS technique. This paper investigates the performance of a soft subgrade and contaminated ballast section of rail line in the UK, before and after screw pile TBS. Pre and post remediation, a computer vision-based system was used to measure rail vertical deflections during train passages and then analysed to quantify the trackbed stiffness. Additionally, 3D finite element models are created and validated by the site measurements. The finite element models are used to simulate a range of different scenarios exploring how changes to the TBS piling layout and/or further works, such as ballast improvement could add further improvements or design efficiencies. Site measurements show TBS reduced rail deflection by 20–30%, indicating that micro-piling is an effective technique for soft subgrades. The finite element analysis revealed the efficiency of micro-piling is highly dependent on the conditions of ballast, strength of the ground at the pile toe, and the pile arrangement. When the aforementioned are optimised the rail deflection could be reduced to approximately 50% of the pre TBS condition. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Abstract: The thermal effect of electrokinetic remediation (EKR) is a kind of energy dissipation, which is an important part of the useless work in the process of EKR. Therefore, this study aims to reveal the phenomenon and mechanism of thermal effect and the energy distribution mechanism in the process of EKR. To explore the distribution mechanism of soil temperature during the EKR process, nine groups of orthogonal EKR experiments lasting 120 h were carried out. The experimental results show that the phenomenon of thermal effect is common in the process of electric remediation of uranium pollution, and it is positively correlated with the current of the system. At the same time, soil pH, moisture, and conductivity are all related to soil temperature. According to the range analysis, the voltage gradient has the greatest impact on the current utilization rate. Under the conditions of 0.5 V/cm and 0.5 mol/L citric acid (CA), the maximum removal efficiency of U(VI) in the soil is 36.58%, and the maximum current utilization rate η is 3.85%. In general, the study of the general law of thermal effect in the process of EKR will provide theoretical support for weakening the effect of thermal effect, avoiding wasting more energy, improving the utilization efficiency of energy, and transforming the EKR process. Therefore, this study has a positive significance for the law of thermal effect in the process of EK and the engineering application of EKR technology. Highlights: • Current utilization efficiency and energy distribution mechanisms were discovered during the EKR process. • The distribution mechanism of temperature in soil cell was revealed in the EKR process. • Optimizing experimental combination, providing a theoretical basis for engineering practical application. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The article provides an overview of the problems associated with the uranium tailings in Istiqlol city. Many uranium heritage sites in Central Asia, including the uranium tailings in Istiqlol, hadn’t been mothballed be-fore the collapse of the USSR. The burial complex consists of a quarry, dumps of the “Poor Ores Factory”, an unpreserved open mine, destroyed industrial buildings and four tailings which contain 12 million tons of the uranium production waste. In the area of the tailings, the ambient dose rate of gamma radiation is 0.5–0.6 µSv/h, and at some points it reaches 3.0–4.0 µSv/h. The average annual radon emission from the surface is estimated at 3.9×1011 Bq/year. The contaminated areas also include the Sarym-Sakhly Sai stream, mine, industrial and quarry waters, which are characterized by an increased content of 234U, 238U and 226Ra. The facilities aren’t physically fenced, allowing free access for the public and livestock. Natural disasters such as mudflows, landslides, and earthquakes can lead to an ecological disaster. Attention is paid to the ways of solving problems such as monitoring radionuclides in water, soil, and air; working with the local population to inform and involve them in rehabilitation work; donors search. The Program for the Implementation of the National Concept for the Rehabilitation of Tailings of Uranium Ore Processing Wastes for 2016–2024 was developed and approved by the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan to minimize the radiation impact on the population and the environment. Implementation of the Program requires significant financial investments and trained personals in the field of radiation safety. Only through the joint efforts of the state, population and international organizations is it possible to fully carry out rehabilitation works. Only by joint the state, public, and international organizations efforts, it is possible to solve these problems. Also, one of the main reasons why the population had received unnecessary overexposure was its ignorance of the danger of using water, soil and building materials contaminated with radionuclides. Therefore, the culture of radiation safety should be studied starting from middle school, where students will be taught about ionizing radiation and possible ways of exposure. Then, both cases of intake of radionuclides into the body, which could have been avoided, and radiophobia among the population living near the extraction and processing of uranium ore, will be much lower. Some social and economic aspects are also touched upon. © 2023, Saint-Petersburg Research Institute of Radiation Hygiene after Professor P.V. Ramzaev. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The long-term assessment of radon (Rn) is a critical factor in evaluating the exposure risk faced by building occupants, and it plays a significant role in determining the implementation of Rn remediation strategies aimed at enhancing indoor air quality (IAQ). Meteorological parameters, such as temperature, relative humidity, and atmospheric pressure, as well as geological factors, such as soil properties, uranium content, rock formations, parent rock weathering, and water content, can significantly impact the assessment of Rn exposure risk and the selection of appropriate mitigation measures. A continuous monitoring campaign of a National Architectural Heritage building serving as a museum open to the public for a period of 546 consecutive days was conducted. The results of the in situ investigation revealed a broad range of seasonality in indoor Rn emission, with a negative correlation observed between Rn concentration and air temperature. The data indicated that indoor Rn concentration increases in the winter months as a result of reduced indoor air temperature and decreased air exchange, while it decreases in the summer months due to increased air temperature and enhanced natural ventilation. However, the implementation of high ventilation rates to improve IAQ may result in significant heat losses, thereby affecting the thermal comfort of building occupants during the winter months. Therefore, it is imperative to achieve a balance between ventilation practices and energy efficiency requirements to ensure both IAQ and thermal comfort for building occupants. © 2023 by the authors.},

We sampled soils and cultured root-associated fungi from blue grama grass (Bouteloua gracilis) collected from lands with a history of uranium (U) mining and contrasted against communities in nearby, off-mine sites. Plant root-associated fungal communities from mine sites were lower in taxonomic richness and diversity than root fungi from paired, off-mine sites. We assessed potential functional consequences of unique mine-associated soil microbial communities using plant bioassays, which revealed that plants grown in mine soils in the greenhouse had significantly lower germination, survival, and less total biomass than plants grown in off-mine soils but did not alter allocation patterns to roots versus shoots. We identified candidate culturable root-associated Ascomycota taxa for bioremediation and increased understanding of the biological impacts of heavy metals on microbial communities and plant growth. © 2023 The Mycological Society of America.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the comprehensive analysis of long-term study of radioecological situation at the site of the former Lermontov Production Association “Almaz” (LPA “Almaz”). The history of LPA and "uranium heritage" objects creation has been considered: the association consisted of two mines with adits and rock dumps, the hydrometallurgical plant and a dump. Emissions and discharges of natural radionuclides during the LPA “Almaz” operation (1950-1991) and the impact of radiation on human health and the environment after its shutdown were assessed. Though a lot of remediation work was made, in the near future radiation safety in the territory of the former LPA “Almaz” location is not guaranteed. The important radioecological problems in the territory of the enterprise location have been specified. Areas of terrestrial ecosystems, industrial and residential buildings in which the content of radon isotopes in the atmosphere exceeded the standards have been identified. Heavy natural radionuclides with high specific activity have been found in dumps, and the increased content of the radionuclides have been found in the soil of adjacent agricultural fields. Risks of exceeding the established national radiation safety standards NRB-99/2009 for natural radionuclides in underground waters of mines and in some foodstuffs produced near the tunnels have been assessed. Gaps in radioecological data for a number of radionuclides, ecosystems and food groups have been identified. The necessity of further monitoring of the radiation situation at the objects of LPA”Almaz” and in the territory of the enterprise location is substantiated. The program for radioecological monitoring of the lowest atmospheric layer, terrestrial (natural, agricultural, anthropogenic) and aquatic (groundwater and surface water) ecosystems. Monitoring objects, parameters to be measured, list of radionuclides, as well as periodicity of taking samples and making measurements in objects of the LPA”Almaz” and adjacent territory have ben specified. Monitoring will provide data for a correct assessment of human and biota radiation doses, with account for all dose-generating radionuclides and exposure pathways. © 2023 National Medical Research Radiological Centre of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation.

	abstract = {Completely randomized experimental design statistical modeling techniques were employed to analyze exposure rate measurements for evaluating hypothetical natural background post uranium mill operations at Coles Hill, Virginia uranium milling processes. The proposed Coles Hill Uranium Mine is situated upstream of the Banister River. This River is nearly homogenous throughout the reach length used in analysis and feeds into the mouth of Kerr Reservoir, Lake Gaston, which serves as the main drinking water source for cities in the Hampton Roads area including Norfolk, Virginia Beach, and Chesapeake. A critical scan value (=DCGLscan) was developed to flag anomalies of surface contamination during simulated post remediation final status surveys. The natural background was critical for meeting the Multi-Agency Radiation Survey and Site Investigation Manual guidance for post remediation final status surveys. The overarching null hypothesis suggested that the selected mean natural background is equal to the survey unit's mean natural background. Using SAS Procedures Shapiro-Wilk Test, ANOVA, and CR, it was decided the exposure rate data was normal, had no extreme outliers, and no collinearity between the number of samples (=treatment) and the areas (=block). Using the q-hyper (hypergeometric) distribution, the soil sampling density was decided for a final status survey unit. The most likely worst-case catastrophic failure analysis, 500-year event, such as the1969 Hurricane Camille of 69 centimeters of rain in Nelson County, Virginia was included in the model. The model showed impact was minimal at most to the Banister River's drinking water and likely less than the Virginia's Drinking Water Standards for gross alpha, 226Ra and 228Ra, and total uranium.  © 2024 Health Physics Society.},

	abstract = {The former Lamprecht uranium mine facility in Texas ceased operations well before the new millennium. However, decommissioning activities were never completed by the licensee. Consequently, a legal proceeding was authorized between state and licensee representatives. Meanwhile, state funds were used to hire an independent contractor to perform radiological surveys and assess the magnitude of residual radioactivity across the terrain at the site. The purpose of this study was to apply advanced spatial statistical methods to the survey data measured by contractors at the Lamprecht site to precisely predict remaining radioactive hotspot locations post soil remediation activities. To accomplish this, descriptive statistics such as Google maps and boxplots along with inferential spatial statistical techniques, e.g., kriging and semivariograms, were employed. R coding was also used throughout. Specifically, the descriptive statistical methods included geographical mapping of targeted areas at the site coupled with summary statistics. Inferentially, spatial analytical techniques were employed to pinpoint the locations of elevated radiation levels above regulatory limits. Our results suggest that fewer hotspots were identified after remediation activities were completed at the site. This study provides an additional analytical resource for the State of Texas regarding the release of this former in situ leach uranium mine site to landowners for unrestricted use.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

	abstract = {Uranium (U) pollution in soils is prevalent worldwide and poses a significant health risk that will require remediation approaches. However, traditional U bioreduction by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) are sensitive to oxygen and are not suitable for treating aerobic topsoil. Bioprecipitation of U into uranyl phosphate (U–P) mediated by phosphate-solubilizing microorganism (PSM) is not affected by oxygen. In this study, PSM strains were isolated and used for U-contaminated soil remediation. Microbial metabolites and the mechanism of PSM bioprecipitation were revealed. The results showed that strain Enterobacter sp. N1-10 had the highest phosphate-solubilizing capacity (dissolved P was 409.51 ± 8.48 mg/L). Uranium bioprecipitation was investigated by culturing the bacterium in the presence of 50 mg/L U and in the cell-free culture supernatant. The results showed that strain N1–10 had a high U removal rate (99.45 ± 0.43 %) after adding 50 mg/L U to the culture medium. A yellow precipitate was immediately formed when uranyl nitrate solution was added to the cell-free culture supernatant. The analysis indicated that bacterium produced lactic acid (37.58 mg/L), citric acid (4.76 mg/L), succinic acid (2.03 mg/L), and D-glucuronic acid (1.94 mg/L); the four organic acids solubilized Ca3(PO4)2 to form stable uranyl phosphate precipitate. The application of strain N1-10 and Ca3(PO4)2 significantly decreased the bioavailability of soil U (43.54 ± 0.52 %). In addition, pot experiments showed that PSM N1-10 and Ca3(PO4)2 promoted plant growth and markedly reduced U accumulation by pakchoi. These results demonstrate that PSM N1-10 and Ca3(PO4)2 exhibit a great potential for U bioremediation. © 2023},

	abstract = {Solid process fine waste or tailings of a uranium mill is a potential source of release of radiologically significant gaseous radon (222Rn). A number of variables such as radium (226Ra) content, porosity, moisture content, and tailings density can affect the extent of emanation from the tailings. Further, if a cover material is used for remediation purposes, additional challenges due to changes in the matrix characteristics in predicting the radon flux can be anticipated. The uranium mill tailings impoundment systems at Jaduguda have been in use for the long-term storage of fine process waste (tailings). A pilot-scale remediation exercise of one of the tailings ponds has been undertaken with 30 cm soil as a cover material. For the prediction of the radon flux, a numerical model has been developed to account for the radon exhalation process at the remediated site. The model can effectively be used to accommodate both the continuous and discrete variable inputs. Depth profiling and physicochemical characterization for the remediated site have been done for the required input variables of the proposed numerical model. The predicted flux worked out is well below the reference level of 0.74 Bq m−2 s−1 IAEA (2004). © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {The soil microbial diversity in the gangue accumulation area is severely stressed by a variety of heavy metals, while the influence of long-term recovery of herbaceous plants on the ecological structure of gangue-contaminated soil is to be explored. Therefore, we analysed the differences in physicochemical properties, elemental changes, microbial community structure, metabolites and expression of related pathways in soils in the 10- and 20-year herbaceous remediation areas of coal gangue. Our results showed that phosphatase, soil urease, and sucrase activities of gangue soils significantly increased in the shallow layer after herbaceous remediation. However, in zone T1 (10-year remediation zone), the contents of harmful elements, such as Thorium (Th; 1.08-fold), Arsenic (As; 0.78-fold), lead (Pb; 0.99-fold), and uranium (U; 0.77-fold), increased significantly, whereas the soil microbial abundance and diversity also showed a significant decreasing trend. Conversely, in zone T2 (20-year restoration zone), the soil pH significantly increased by 1.03- to 1.06-fold and soil acidity significantly improved. Moreover, the abundance and diversity of soil microorganisms increased significantly, the expression of carbohydrates in soil was significantly downregulated, and sucrose content was significantly negatively correlated with the abundance of microorganisms, such as Streptomyces. A significant decrease in heavy metals was observed in the soil, such as U (1.01- to 1.09-fold) and Pb (1.13- to 1.25-fold). Additionally, the thiamin synthesis pathway was inhibited in the soil of the T1 zone; the expression level of sulfur (S)-containing histidine derivatives (Ergothioneine) was significantly up-regulated by 0.56-fold in the shallow soil of the T2 zone; and the S content in the soil significantly reduced. Aromatic compounds were significantly up-regulated in the soil after 20 years of herbaceous plant remediation in coal gangue soil, and microorganisms (Sphingomonas) with significant positive correlations with benzene ring-containing metabolites, such as Sulfaphenazole, were identified. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

In Syngonium podophyllum-Peperomia tetraphylla co-planting system, the total amount of ethanol-extracted uranium and deionized water-extracted uranium with higher toxicity in their roots were reduced by 10.30% and 7.17%, respectively, which reduced the toxicity of uranium to plants. Plants interaction can inhibit the reduction of U(VI) in the root of Peperomia tetraphylla, which is conducive to the transport of uranium from roots to shoots. In addition, uranium in plants mainly existed in the cell wall (54.44%–66.52%) and the soluble fraction (23.85%–32.89%).

	abstract = {The decommissioning of uranium tailings (UMT) is usually accompanied by uranium (U) contamination in soil, which poses a serious threat to human health and ecological security. Therefore, the remediation of uranium pollution in soil is imminent from ecological and environmental points of view. In recent years, the use of biochar stabilizers to repair uranium tailings (UMT) soil has become a research hotspot. In this study, a novel phosphorus-modified bamboo biochar (PBC) cross-linked Mg–Al layered double-hydroxide composite (PBC@LDH) was prepared. The hyperaccumulator plant Indian mustard (Brassica juncea L.) was selected as the test plant for outdoor pot experiments, and the stabilizers were added to the UMT soil at the dosage ratio of 15 g kg−1, which verified the bioconcentrate and translocate of U and associated heavy metal Pb in the UMT soil by Indian mustard after stabilizer remediated. The results shown that, after 50 days of growth, compared with the untreated sample (CK), the Indian mustard in PBC@LDH treatment possessed a better growth and its biomass weight of whole plant was increased by 52.7%. Meanwhile, the bioconcentration factors (BF) of U and Pb for PBC@LDH treatment were significantly decreased by 73.4% and 34.2%, respectively; and the translocation factors (TF) were also commendable reduced by 15.1% and 2.4%, respectively. Furthermore, the Tessier available forms of U and Pb in rhizosphere soil showed a remarkably decrease compared with CK, which reached by 55.97% and 14.1% after PBC@LDH stabilization, respectively. Complexation, precipitation, and reduction of functional groups released by PBC@LDH with U and Pb described the immobilization mechanisms of biochar stabilizer preventing U and Pb enrichment in Indian mustard. As well as, the formation of U-containing vesicles was prevented by the precipitation of −OH functional groups with free U and Pb ions around the cell tissue fluids and vascular bundle structure of plant roots, thereby reducing the migration risk of toxic heavy metals to above-ground parts. In conclusion, this research demonstrates that the PBC@LDH stabilizer offers a potentially effective amendment for the remediation of U contaminated soil. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Purpose: Assessment of the current radiation situation around dumps of mine No. 2 of the Lermontov Production Association Almaz after remediation. Material and methods: The methods of pedestrian gamma survey using the portable spectrometric complex MKS-01A “Multirad-M”. Soil sampling was used to measure radionuclide specific activities. Activities of gamma emitting radionuclides were measured by a stationary gamma spectrometer of the CANBERRA Company. Activities of 210Po and 210Pb following radiochemical separation of these radionuclides were measured using the radiometric installation UMF-2000. Short-term measurements of radon EEC were carried out with aerosol alpha-radiometer RAA-20P2 Poisk. Results: After remediation, gamma ambient dose equivalent rate does not exceed 0,5 μSv/h at all dumps, with the exception of local areas around tunnels No. 9, 10 and 11. In the area around tunnel No. 9, gamma ambient dose equivalent rate reaches 0,55 μSv/h, in the area of tunnel No. 10-5 μSv/h and higher, and in the area of tunnel No. 11 - up to 0,9 μSv/h. In the areas around all tunnels, except for tunnel No.11, soil does not belong to solid radioactive waste. In a small area near tunnel No. 11, the content of radionuclides in the soil exceeds the criteria for classifying as solid radioactive waste. Radon EEC in the surveyed area generally did not exceed 30 Bq/m3. Increased values up to 200 Bq/m3 were registered in the area of tunnel dumps, the mouths of which were not fully isolated (tunnels No. 6, 7 and 10). Moreover, directly at the mouth of tunnel No. 10, radon EEC values reached 65000±11000 Bq/m3. Conclusions: At all surveyed remedied dumps, except for dumps of tunnels No. 10 and 11, the radiation situation in some areas does not meet the requirements established in the remediation project in accordance with the “Health Care Rules for the Closure, Conservation and Conversion of Enterprises for the Mining and Milling Radioactive Ores” and stay in these territories does not pose a hazard to the population. © 2022 State Research Center, Burnasyan Federal Medical Biophysical Center of Federal Medical Biological Agency.

	abstract = {The goal of this research is phytoremediation of uranium-contaminated soil. In the preliminary investigation, Macleaya cordata (Willd.) R. Br. was found to grow in abundance around uranium tailings. Afterward, the field tests to remove uranium from the contaminated soil by the M. cordata (Willd.) R. Br. were conducted. After 3 years of treatment, the contents of uranium in the shallow, middle, and deep layers decreased by 51.2%, 16.6%, and 90.3%, respectively, indicating the transfer of uranium from the tailings. The content of uranium in the roots, stems, and leaves of M. cordata that had been planted for 3 years was significantly higher than that in the first year, indicating the transfer of uranium to M. cordata (The uranium content of the part of M. cordata underground is 1.870 ± 0.288 mg/kg and the content in the aboveground part is 79.815 ± 0.911 mg/kg after 3 years). The results of Mi-Seq indicated that microbial communities were exposed to variations and that microbes, such as Bacillus, Lactococcus, Nitrosomonadaceae, and Roseiflexus, were involved in the remediation of uranium-contaminated soil, demonstrating that the reduced uranium content in the tailings is a result of the joint action by plants and microbes. An infrared analysis indicated that the -OH and COO- groups are the main functional groups in M. cordata involved in the bioconcentration of uranium. Moreover, as time advances, the uranium in the tailings was readily concentrated by the plant, demonstrating that the remediation of radioactive contamination by M. cordata is viable. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.},

	abstract = {Radon, a gaseous radioactive decay product of naturally-occurring uranium is widely distributed in the environment in rocks and soils and, in certain circumstances, can accumulate in the built environment. Initial studies confirmed a direct link between exposure to both radon gas and its short-lived radioactive progeny, and increased lung-cancer incidence, and demonstrated that radon levels in domestic housing can be sufficiently high to expose occupants to increased risk of lung-cancer. Subsequent studies worldwide have shown that it is cost-effective to detect and reduce domestic radon levels in order to reduce this risk. Recent advances in the early detection of lung-cancer, coupled with the development of improved treatment procedures, have progressively improved survival from the disease, with the numbers surviving at 5 years doubling over recent years, during which period the real costs of lung cancer treatment have risen by around 30%. In the meantime, however, in addition to radon and tobacco-smoke, other airborne pollutants have been identified as risk-factors for lung-cancer. This paper reviews both these actual developments and anticipated future trends, and concludes that since these advances in diagnosis and treatment of lung-cancer have had only a modest effect on cost-effectiveness, it is still important to conduct radon monitoring and remediation programmes. While the general increase in life-expectancy improves the cost-effectiveness of radon remediation programmes significantly, reducing tobacco-smoking incidence reduces that cost-effectiveness but with the overall benefit of reducing radon-related lung-cancers. The challenge remains of encouraging affected householders to remediate their homes to reduce radon levels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

In this study, a novel phosphorus-modified bamboo biochar (PBC) cross-linked Mg–Al layered double-hydroxide (LDH) composite (“PBC@LDH”) was successfully prepared by phosphate pre-impregnation and a hydrothermal method with Mg–Al LDH. Physicochemical analysis revealed that phosphorus-containing functional groups and Mg–Al LDH were grafted onto the pristine biochar (BC) matrix. Laboratory-scale incubation and column leaching experiments were performed on the prepared BC, PBC, and PBC@LDH. The results showed that, at a dosage of 10%, the PBC@LDH composite had a commendable ability to immobilize U in soil. After 40 days of incubation with the stabilizer, the more mobile U was converted into immobilized species. Furthermore, during a column leaching experiment with simulated acid rain, the cumulative loss and leaching efficiency of U were remarkably reduced by PBC@LDH treatment compared with the control, reaching 53% and 54%, respectively. Surface complexation, co-precipitation, and reduction described the adsorption and immobilization mechanisms.

Rapid development, from phenotypic to genotypic characterization of biometallurgy microorganisms, as well as from theoretical to practical applications, has been made in China since the 1950s. The integrated applications of biometallurgy technology in copper, gold, and uranium extraction ensured China's economic reserves of strategic mineral resources.

	abstract = {Industrial activity has left a legacy of pollution by radionuclides and heavy metals. The exposure of terrestrial environments to increased levels of ionising radiation and toxic elements is of concern, not only because of the immediate effects to biota but also because of the potential risk of mobilisation into higher levels of a food chain. Here, we present a study that extends our knowledge of how arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi contribute to the mobilisation of non-essential elements in environments such as former mine sites, and provides a perspective that will be of interest for the management and remediation of such sites. Summary Accumulation and transfer of long-lived radionuclides and toxic metals in terrestrial environments is of major concern because of potential mobilisation into food chains. In this study, we aimed to compare the role of four different arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) cultures on the transfer of non-essential elements into Plantago lanceolata from a naturally contaminated soil source. Soil from an abandoned uranium (238U) mine was collected as a natural source of 238U, thorium (232Th), arsenic (As) and lead (Pb). P. lanceolata was inoculated with four AMF cultures (Rhizophagus irregularis DAOM181602, Acaulospora longula BEG8, Scutellospora calospora BEG245 and Funneliformis mosseae BEG12) to compare the uptake and transfer from root to shoot. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectroscopy and ICP-absorption emission spectroscopy analyses provided quantification of total elemental concentrations in soil and plant tissues. Two of the AMF cultures, A. longula and F. mosseae, had contrasting roles in toxic element partitioning in plant tissue of P. lanceolata. F. mosseae increased the accumulation of 238U, 232Th, Pb, As and Cu in shoots whereas A. longula induced increased partitioning of 232Th, Ca, Fe and Zn in roots. The inoculation treatments and the differential accumulation of these elements had no significant effect on plant biomass. The use of different AMF cultures in enhancing phytoremediation of contaminated environments requires a wider understanding of the contribution of different AMF cultures to non-essential element acquisition as well as to plant nutrition. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {Introduction. The work was completed on the remediation of dumps located in the area of nine tunnels of mine No. 1 of the Lermontov production association “Almaz” over 2014–2015. The article presents the results of a study of the radiation situation on these dumps five years after the remediation. Materials and methods. During the survey, the methods of pedestrian gamma survey were used using a portable spectrometric complex MKS-01A “Multirad-M” and soil sampling with subsequent measurement of the specific activity of radionuclides using a stationary gamma spectrometer manufactured by CANBERRA. The activity of 210Po and 210Pb was measured using a UMF-2000 radiometric setup after their radiochemical isolation. Results. After the remediation of the dump areas, where gamma ambient dose equivalent rate exceeds 0.5 μSv/h, areas significantly decreased and do not exceed 10% of the total dump area, with the exception of the dumps of tunnel No. 42. On the territory of all surveyed dumps, except for dumps of tunnels No. 10 and No. 26, there are areas where gamma ambient dose equivalent rate exceeds 0.6 μSv/h, which is prohibited in accordance with the adopted remediation criteria. Not all tunnel mouths are isolated. Limitations. It is assumed that comparing the content of radionuclides in soil with the criteria for classifying them as solid radioactive waste 238U and 230Th are in secular equilibrium. Measurements of the total alpha-activity in the soil and comparison with the recultivation criteria for this parameter were not carried out. Conclusion. At present, the radiation situation in some areas of all surveyed reclaimed dumps, except for the dumps of tunnels No. 10 and No. 26, does not meet the requirements established in the remediation project. © 2022 Izdatel'stvo Meditsina.

	abstract = {An eco-friendly dust suppression and sand-fixation liquid mulching film was prepared via a facile secondary spraying process in this work. Water polyurethane (WPU) was blended with dissolved humic acid (HA) firstly, and then the blend solutions (HWPU) were sprayed on the surface of cationic starch (CS) / sodium lignosulfonate (LS) film to synthesize the liquid mulching film (CLS-HWPU). The effects of liquid mulching film composition on mechanical properties in dry and wet states were investigated. The results showed that the optimal composition of liquid mulching film was: 3% (CS), 0.9 % (LS), 1.5 % (glycerol), 2% (HA), and 30 % (WPU). The CLS-HWPU liquid mulching films were characterized in terms of light transmittance, degradation performance test, contact angle test, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (ATR-FTIR), thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), and erosion resistance test. The results indicated that the CLS-HWPU film had good UV resistance, thermal stability, anti-erosion, and biodegradation. The CLS-HWPU film meets the demand of dust suppression and sand-fixation in dusty areas and desertification environments, which opens a new application field for liquid mulching film with high safety and environmental protection. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Radiological and environmental risk assessments of uranium require knowledge of its immediate and long-term behaviour in the soil system. To better understand U(VI) behaviour in contaminated soil, a mesocosm experiment was conducted from 2018 to 2021 by amending soil with U(VI). Study revealed that short-term behaviour of U(VI) is controlled by soil Fe-oxide (hydroxide) content, as approximately 55% of total U binds to the soil reducible fraction within a month of contamination. However, the stability of U-Fe oxide (hydroxide) complexes decreases with aging, possibly due to bio-geochemically induced transformation of Fe-oxide/hydroxide minerals. For this reason, long-term performance testing of the Fe-based permeable reactive barriers for U immobilization is recommended. Study shows that, about 50% of total U in top soil leached out in the first year. Meanwhile, progressive incorporation of U in different soil fractions was also taking place with ageing. X-ray absorption near edge spectra and carbonate leaching studies confirm that, in the long-term reductive transformation of U (VI) to U (IV) and enrichment of U in the residual fractions are important processes that lead to U immobilization. The study also highlights the challenges of long-term study in an open system due to its dynamic nature. The study suggests that for reliable radiological environmental impact assessment, a long-term study is required and the findings of this study could be valuable in hazard management and remediation strategy development. © 2022},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic activities such as uranium mining activities, primarily associated with decades of nuclear fuel production and weapon making, had accumulated a huge amount of uranium tailings (residue) and abundant hazardous uranium waste. Thus, caused an increasingly serious uranium contamination in surrounding soil and under ground water, which posed a potential threat to the human health and social security around the world. In particular, radioactive uranium commonly present as the uranyl cation, is highly soluble and mobile under oxidizing conditions and poses great danger to human health. Therefore, it is significant to focus on developing efficient remediation and long-term remediation strategies of increasingly severe uranium contamination. Various methods for the remediation of uranium were emerged in an endless stream. Traditional physical and chemical remediation approaches based on pump and treat practice, such as lime neutralization, anion exchange, activated aluminum and biosorption, were not only prohibitively expensive but could also be limited by poor extraction efficiency, inhibitory competing ions and massive waste production. Besides, bringing the radioactive contaminants up to the surface could increase health and safety risks for cleanup workers and the public. So, there was a great need for cost-effective alternatives to treat uranium-contaminated groundwater and prevent its further migration and spread through the deep subsurface. However, the emergency of bioremediation technologies provided an eco-friendly, high-efficiency, stably to solve this problem. Bioremediation technologies had attracted extensive attention of researchers, which had great research value and broad application prospect. It was found that under the stress of uranium, microorganisms used the deposit or other external substances to gain energy for metabolism in order to grow and survive, and deposited the dissolved U(VI) through biological reduction, biomineralization and other ways, reducing the concentration of U(VI) in the solution. At present, the mechanisms of microbial remediation of uranium contamination mainly included bioreduction, biomineralization, biosorption and bioaccumulation. Uranium bioreduction had been proposed as a bioremediation technique, stimulated by adding an electron donor to promote enzymaticreduction of aqueous U(VI) to insoluble U(IV). The speciation of bioreduced uranium was often stated to be uraninite (UO2). Bioreduction was widely used in field tests for its high efficiency, low cost and simple operation. However, potential concerns associated with the use of bioreduction as a remediation technique from whether reduced U(IV) would be stable over long time periods, especially when the environment changed, such as the presence of oxygen and nitrate, solidified U(IV) would be reoxidized to the dissolved U(VI). Biomineralisation referred to the process by which metals precipitated with microbially generated ligands such as sulfide or phosphate, or ascarbonates or hydroxides in response to localized alkaline conditionsat the cell surface. Adding inorganic phosphate directly into the contaminated area could also precipitate U(VI). However, due to its high activity, it was likely to precipitate rapidly with metal ions, resulting in a decrease in the permeability coefficient of the adding point. Compared with bioreduction, biomineralization of U(VI) phosphate was observed over a wide pH range and in the presence of high uranium and nitrate concentrations, and might be a complementary approach to bioreduction. The cost of organophosphate was the biggest obstacle to the wide application of biomineralization remediation technology. In addition, some researchers believed that the rapid precipitation of metals on the cell surface could hinder the cell metabolism and reduced the remediation effect. Biosorption described the passive uptake of uranium to the surface of living or dead microbial cells. Despite the potential for bacteria to biosorb uranium, it was unlikely to be useful in the context of bioremediation. Problems associated with biosorption were that desorption from cell surfaces could be as rapid assorption, and other cations competed for binding site. Cell surfaces could also quickly become saturated, preventing further biosorption. Sorbed material could be re-released to solution when cells died and decomposed. Microbial cells were also able to accumulate a broad range of metalions via "bioaccumulation" mechanisms. Although of academic interest, there was scant evidence suggesting bioaccumulation of uranium would be a viable technique for bioremediating contaminated land or water. Uranium remediation rates and effects had been extensively studied, with most studies conducted in microcosms containing suspended cells. However, the results of remediation rates and effects between studies or between different microbial species were often difficult to predict because of the large variation in the experimental conditions. Many physical, geochemical and biological factors could affect the remediation effects, including aqueous uranyl speciation and uranium initial concentration, cell concentration, temperature and pH, electron donor, bicarbonate, competing electron acceptors and other compounds. Besides, these factors and their effects were often closely coupled. The mobility and bioavailability of uranium varied with the type and complexity of the complex formed by uranium. And other culture parameters could substantially influence the reduction effects, because they influenced U speciation in aqueous environments. Thus, an understanding of U speciation was pivotal when considering the design and operation of bioremediation systems for U(VI) removal. In addition, many of the parameters, such as pH, temperature and high concentrations of other metal ions could have direct effects on the growth and activity of U(VI)-remediation microorganisms. Overall, it was clear that microbial remediation had a significant impact on uranium contamination across a wide range of environments and would be important in managing contaminated land sites. But there were also some shortcomings that needed to be solved urgently. The long-term stability of the bioreduced U(IV) solids was still questionable and further research was needed to underst and the mechanisms that led to the formation of most stable U(IV) products to effectively decrease U(IV) reoxidation and ensure longevity and environmental safety. Research worth further exploration in the future included: (1) Screening and cultivating the strains with higher remediation efficiency; (2) In the premise of high effect of remediation, choose cheaper carbon and phosphorus sources to promote the remediation of uranium contamination by target strains; (3) Molecular biological research methods were used to understand the metabolic pathways and figured out the succession of microbial community in the whole process of remediation. (4) Combined remediation method was adopted to make up for the possible deficiency of single remediation method, so as to obtain better remediation effect and shorten remediation period. © Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Rare Metals.

	abstract = {The effects of breccia pipe uranium mining in the Grand Canyon watershed (Arizona) on ecological and cultural resources are largely unknown. We characterized the exposure of biota to uranium and co-occurring ore body elements during active ore production and at a site where ore production had recently concluded. Our results indicate that biota have taken up uranium and other elements (e.g., arsenic, cadmium, copper, molybdenum, uranium) from exposure to ore and surficial contamination, like blowing dust. Results indicate the potential for prolonged exposure to elements and radionuclides upon conclusion of active ore production. Mean radium-226 in deer mice was up to 4 times greater than uranium-234 and uranium-238 in those same samples; this may indicate a potential for, but does not necessarily imply, radium-226 toxicity. Soil screening benchmarks for uranium and molybdenum and other toxicity thresholds for arsenic, copper, selenium, uranium (e.g., growth effects) were exceeded in vegetation, invertebrates, and rodents (Peromyscus spp., Thomomys bottae, Tamias dorsalis, Dipodomys deserti). However, the prevalence and severity of microscopic lesions in rodent tissues (as direct evidence of biological effects of uptake and exposure) could not be definitively linked to mining. Our data indicate that land managers might consider factors like species, seasonal changes in environmental concentrations, and bioavailability, when determining mine permitting and remediation in the Grand Canyon watershed. Ultimately, our results will be useful for site-specific ecological risk analysis and can support future decisions regarding the mineral extraction withdrawal in the Grand Canyon watershed and elsewhere. © 2020},

	abstract = {Gold and uranium mining has resulted in elevated concentrations of As and U contaminants in groundwater and soil, which has become a paramount concern for the environment and public health. Nanocleaning technology is one of the few permanent treatment alternatives to remove metal contaminants from soils. In recent years, nano-sized FeS, a washing solution that uses nanocleaning technology, has elicited extensive interest in environmental remediation because it does not produce secondary pollution. In this study, As and U were removed from contaminated soil by employing nano-sized FeS washing solution biologically synthesized by the iron-reducing bacteria Acidiphilium cryputum JF-5 and sulphate-reducing bacteria Desulfovibrio vulgaris miyazaki SRB. After cleaning with a nano-sized FeS suspension solution, culture-medium and pure-water for three cycles, the concentration of As in the nano-sized FeS experiment was higher than that of U, suggesting that the cleaning effect for As was better than that for U. The As and U removal rates of the nano-sized FeS cleaning experiment were 12% and 1.59%, respectively, over the three cycles. By using the sequential extraction method, the nano-sized FeS cleaning experiments mainly removed the As fraction bound to Fe/Al oxides. An ATR-FTIR spectral analysis indicated that the band observed at 461 cm−1 was attributed to the ν4 symmetric stretching mode of AsO43−. The obvious vibrations observed at 798 cm−1 and 778 cm−1, were assigned to the ν1 vibration of AsO33−. The band at 834 cm−1 was assigned to the weak vibration of UO2 while the band at 949 cm−1 was attributed to the Fe–O–D bending vibration. The results of this study provide helpful information and references for designing long-term and efficient bioremediation strategies for As- and U-containing soils. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Microbially mediated sulfate reduction is a ubiquitous process in many subsurface systems. Isotopic fractionation is characteristic of this anaerobic process, since sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) favor the reduction of the lighter sulfate isotopologue (S32O42−) over the heavier isotopologue (S34O42−). Detection of isotopic shifts has been utilized as a proxy for the onset of sulfate reduction in subsurface systems such as oil reservoirs and aquifers undergoing heavy metal and radionuclide bioremediation. Reactive transport modeling (RTM) of kinetic sulfur isotope fractionation has been applied to field and laboratory studies. We developed a benchmark problem set for the simulation of kinetic sulfur isotope fractionation during microbially mediated sulfate reduction. The benchmark problem set is comprised of three problem levels and is based on a large-scale laboratory column experimental study of organic carbon amended sulfate reduction in soils from a uranium-contaminated aquifer. Pertinent processes impacting sulfur isotopic composition such as microbial sulfate reduction and iron-sulfide reactions are included in the problem set. This benchmark also explores the different mathematical formulations in the representation of kinetic sulfur isotope fractionation as employed in the different RTMs. Participating RTM codes are the following: CrunchTope, TOUGHREACT, PHREEQC, and PHT3D. Across all problem levels, simulation results from all RTMs demonstrate reasonable agreement. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

If this constraint condition is satisfied, the total bioaccumulation amount (TBA) of radionuclide by the plant can be maximized. This is a constrained optimization problem to determine the adequate dose of the chelating agent for phytoremediation of radionuclide-contaminated soil. In this research, an adequate dose of a chelating agent for phytoremediation of radionuclide-contaminated soil was determined by a novel approach using pot experiments. The proposed approach was applied to specify the adequate doses of citric acid (CA) and S,S-ethylenediamine disuccinic acid (EDDS) for phytoremediation of uranium contaminated soil by M. Cordata. By using this method, the adequate doses of CA and EDDS for phytoremediation of 238U, 232Th and 226Ra contaminated soils by M. cordata were measures as 10.0 and 5.0 mmol kg−1, respectively.

	abstract = {Bacillus sp. is widely used in the remediation of uranium-contaminated sites. However, little is known about the competitive process of microbial community in the environment during bioremediation. The bioremediation of uranium tailings using Bacillus sp. was explored, and the bacterial community was analyzed by high-throughput sequencing at different stages of remediation. Bacillus sp. reduced the leaching of uranium from uranium tailings. The lowest uranium con-centration was 17.25 μg/L. Alpha diversity revealed that the abundance and diversity of microorganisms increased with the extension of the culture time. The microbial abundance and diversity were higher in the treatment group than in the control group. The dominant species at the phyla level were Firmicutes and Proteobacteria in the uranium tailings environment, whereas the phylum of Proteobacteria was significantly increased in the treatment group. Based on the genus level, the proportions of Arthrobacter, Rhodococcus and Paenarthrobacter decreased significantly, whereas those of Clostridium sp., Bacillus and Pseudomonas increased dramatically. Hence, the remediation of uranium contamination in the environment was due to the functional microorganisms, which gradu-ally became the dominant strain in the treatment, such as Desulfotomaculum, Desulfosporporosinus, Anaerocolumna, Ruminiclostridium and Burkholderia. These findings provided a promising outlook of the potential for remediation strategies of soil contaminated by uranium. The dynamic characteristics of the microbial community are likely to provide a foundation for the bioremediation process in practice. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Uranium (U) is a naturally occurring, radioactive, toxic trace element that poses severe risks to public and environmental health. Depleted uranium (DU) is widely used in military munitions, including penetrators. Our previous studies showed that in arid landscapes, water-soluble U released from corroded DU penetrators that were buried underground were co-transported upwards with water by evaporation-driven capillary action and eventually precipitated on the ground surface. The first objective of this study was to develop a visualization system to simulate this complex U upward transport mechanism involving cyclic capillary wetting-drying cycles. Multiple visual components such as visual elements, canvases, and animations were created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS programming languages and coordinated to visualize this biogeochemical process in arid ecosystem landscapes. The second objective was to develop an interactive visualization exercise to allow users to study the effect of the type of capillarity solutions on the speed of the U upward transport. This study is significant in the following aspects: • Contributing a clear and comprehensible visualization of the complex U transport mechanism; • Developing a novel visualization coding framework with more advantages in simulating heavy metal upward transport mechanisms than regular software-based simulations; and • Providing educational uses such as an instructional tool in secondary and college STEM classrooms, an outreach material in promoting student interest in STEM topics and raising public awareness of U pollution, and an educational aid for understanding U mobility in order to develop effective heavy metal pollution control and remediation strategies and policies. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Humic acids (HAs) are macromolecular substances that play important roles in different areas of soil, atmosphere, water, and ecological environment restoration. Here, we applied bibliometric analysis to systematically evaluate HAs applications in the environmental field. In-depth analysis of the publication characteristics of 9145 articles published from 1980 to 2020 revealed that the number of articles published on HAs increased rapidly, with China having the largest number of publications (3109), followed by the United States (1949) and Germany (679). Specifically, the Chinese Academy of Sciences had the largest number of publications (647) and was the center of the most productive institutional cooperation network. HAs applications and mechanisms for treating organic pollutants and heavy metals are important research topics in the environmental field. HAs could reduce the toxicity of a variety of organic pollutants or eliminate pollutants through photodegradation and adsorption. These pollutants include antibiotics, herbicides pesticides, fungicides, and other phenolic compounds. Additionally, HAs might be also used to treat heavy metal pollutants, such as mercury, copper, cadmium, uranium, and aluminum. HAs could adsorb heavy metals, thereby reducing their mobility in the environment and toxicity. HAs also have the potential to degrade microplastics and contribute to climate change adaptation. However, bibliometric analysis showed that the molecular structure of HAs remains unclear, thereby limiting clarification of mechanisms and further applications for decontamination. These findings highlight the interaction between HAs and the environment and offer critical insight to support further development of HAs for environmental applications. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This research assessed a variety of native desert plant species for their ability to accumulate toxic elements in an abandoned uranium mine in the Sonoran Desert. Paired soil and plant samples were collected for six species of plants that had naturally re-colonized the mine. The mine soils had a median uranium concentration of 56.0 mg kg−1 (range: MDL to 696) while the plant samples had concentrations of 3.7 mg kg−1 (range: MDL to 20.0). The results showed uranium bioconcentration factors (BCFs) were between 0.051 and 0.234 with the longer-living, woody species having higher concentrations than short-lived herbaceous species. These BCF values were near the high end of values reported in the literature which implies that these desert species were either better at acquiring elements or they have fewer mechanisms to eliminate elements (e.g. litterfall). The life histories of the species were then evaluated on four criteria, namely uranium BCF, inedibility, longevity, and root depth, to assess which species would be best for phytostabilization, which is the use of plants to stabilize the soil to prevent water or wind erosion that might transport contaminants off site. The goal was to select a species that would stabilize the soil without accumulating uranium in the above ground biomass where it could enter the food web and be transported off site. Ultimately, brittlebush (Encelia farinosa A. Gray ex Torr.) was selected because of its low BCF, shallow roots and reasonable longevity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Stone coal contains a relatively high content of natural radionuclides. Its development and utilization will cause radioactive pollution and associated heavy metal pollution to the environment. In recent years, the development and utilization of stone coal has caused radioactive pollution and heavy metal pollution to the environment. More and more public attention has been paid to Jiangxi. As one of the provinces with the most abundant stone coal reserves in the country, most stone coal mines are open-pit mining. The long-term rainwater leaching and surface runoff of abandoned mines have caused serious damage to the surrounding soil environment. In order to study the remediation technology of the radioactive and heavy metal compound contaminated soil around the stone coal mine area, the vibration leaching method was used to conduct the indoor test. According to the soil test results collected on site in a stone coal mine area in Jiangxi Province, the main pollutant indexes were radionuclide uranium and heavy metal zinc and cadmium. According to previous studies, in view of its unique radioactive and heavy metal compound pollution characteristics, hydrochloric acid, citric acid, oxalic acid, EDTA and ferric trichloride were selected as eluents, and the better leaching conditions were determined by controlling leaching concentration and mixed leaching. The results show that in eluents the best comprehensive decontamination effects on compound polluted soil were oxalic acid, hydrochloric acid and ferric trichloride. The best leaching rates under different concentration gradients were 1 mol/L oxalic acid and 1 mol/L hydrochloric acid solution, and the elution effect of combined eluent was improved to some extent compared with a single eluent. The leaching rate of U, Cd and Zn with the mixture of 1 mol/L oxalic acid solution and 1 mol/L hydrochloric acid solution was the highest achieved 99.2%, 97.8% and 43.7%. The research results can be used for the small-scale trial of on-site leaching of remediation of compound contaminated soil, and the potential environmental risks of the soil after leaching and remediation still need to be considered. © 2022 by the Author(s).},

	abstract = {Regional geochemical mapping programs are predominantly based on regolith materials as the sampling media. The use of plant organs has been more limited, despite potential advantages demonstrated in more localised studies that have examined biogeochemical responses to various types of mineralisation or contamination, or sought to identify species with phytoremediation potential. This study investigated the effects of variations in lithology and mining wastes on the multielement chemistry of Pinus brutia (pine) needles and O. europaea (olive) leaves, obtained from low-density traverses across Cyprus and detailed sampling around two Cyprus-style VHMS Cu-deposits. A total of 476 samples were analysed by a combination of inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (pXRF). At the regional scale there are substantial differences in the composition of the pine needles, especially for Ni, Ba, Sr, Mn and Zn, between the major lithological groups that range from the ultramafic and mafic units of the Troodos Ophiolite to the mineralised pillow basalts and various marine carbonate units. Both pine needles and olive leaves display intense Re anomalies in areas with mine wastes and consistently low concentrations in background areas. The response for Cu and other macro- or micronutrient elements to contamination is less pronounced and may reflect barriers to uptake by the plants. The relative magnitude of variations between the different lithologies in median plant metal concentrations is equivalent to that displayed in soils of the Geochemical Atlas of Cyprus (e.g. REE, Zn and Sr), but for some elements the patterns differ substantially. There is close correlation between the ICP-MS and pXRF data for elements where most values are above pXRF detection limits.

	abstract = {Bismuth(III)-based materials are uniquely suited for in situ subsurface remedy applications, as they offer many beneficial properties, including high affinity for multiple contaminants, low human and environmental toxicity, low cost, and synthetic availability. This review summarizes the current research trends in targeted development of bismuth materials potentially useful for subsurface remedy applications, with an emphasis on recent advances in understanding of relevant structure-property relationships. While various bismuth mineral phases can provide frameworks for contaminant sequestration, layered crystalline arrangements are particularly promising because of their electronic and spatial flexibility and their ability to accommodate a wide range of negatively charged species. This translates into a high uptake capacity for several recalcitrant colocated contaminants found at legacy nuclear processing sites, including technetium-99, iodine-129, hexavalent chromium (chromate), and uranium, and offers the potential for both in situ and ex situ remediation applications. Layered bismuth minerals are found in nature, and knowledge of their structure informs the targeted design and cost-effective synthesis of the structurally preorganized materials from readily available bismuth sources for remedial applications in soil and groundwater. This comprehensive review highlights the structure, synthesis, and environmental chemistry of Bi-based materials, including the interaction between Bi-based materials and key environmental contaminants, to explore their potential use for remediation. Bismuth oxyhydroxides, containing clusters of [Bi6O4(OH)4]6+and [Bi6O5(OH)3]5+surrounded by easily exchangeable anions such as nitrate, are versatile and show the greatest potential for environmental remediation applications. Because of their flexible structural arrangement, they have been shown to sequester electronically and sterically different anionic species, including chromate, pertechnetate, iodate, and uranyl carbonate, even when they are present as comingled contaminants in groundwater and pore water containing other competing anions (e.g., nitrate and carbonate) and in contact with subsurface sediments. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

	abstract = {Uranium isotopic signatures can be harnessed to monitor the reductive remediation of subsurface contamination or to reconstruct paleo-redox environments. However, the mechanistic underpinnings of the isotope fractionation associated with U reduction remain poorly understood. Here, we present a coprecipitation study, in which hexavalent U (U(VI)) was reduced during the synthesis of magnetite and pentavalent U (U(V)) was the dominant species. The measured δ238U values for unreduced U(VI) (∼−1.0‰), incorporated U (96 ± 2% U(V), ∼−0.1‰), and extracted surface U (mostly U(IV), ∼0.3‰) suggested the preferential accumulation of the heavy isotope in reduced species. Upon exposure of the U-magnetite coprecipitate to air, U(V) was partially reoxidized to U(VI) with no significant change in the δ238U value. In contrast, anoxic amendment of a heavy isotope-doped U(VI) solution resulted in an increase in the δ238U of the incorporated U species over time, suggesting an exchange between incorporated and surface/aqueous U. Overall, the results support the presence of persistent U(V) with a light isotope signature and suggest that the mineral dynamics of iron oxides may allow overprinting of the isotopic signature of incorporated U species. This work furthers the understanding of the isotope fractionation of U associated with iron oxides in both modern and paleo-environments. © 2022 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society},

	abstract = {Soil and water characteristics and biogeochemical processes can be improved by the application of an integrated technology based on circular economy: designed Technosol. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the superficial application of a designed Technosol, with andic and eutrophic properties, on the rehabilitation of sulfide tailings of a uranium mine (Fé mining area, Spain) was the aim of this study. After 20 months of the Technosol application, the tailing rehabilitation status (Rehabilitated tailing) was compared to a non-rehabilitated tailing (Tailing). To assess the rehabilitation of these systems, several properties were analyzed: chemical characteristics of the materials and their leachates, soil enzymatic activities (dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase, acid phosphatase and urease), basal respiration and several plant endpoints from direct and indirect bioassays and pot experiment using Lolium perennse L. and Trifolium pratense L. Potentially toxic concentrations of Co, Mn and Ni were identified in both available fraction and leachates, pointing out the serious environmental risk posed by the tailing. The improvement of overall physicochemical properties in the rehabilitated tailing materials (e.g., decrease of the hazardous element concentrations in leachates and available fraction, and improvement of the fertility and structure) allowed a quick plant cover with pasture species and provided a suitable habitat for active microbial community (evaluated by increasing dehydrogenase activity and basal respiration). This improvement in the rehabilitated tailing contributed to a significant decrease in the ecotoxicological risk and the spread of hazardous elements. The field application of this specific Technosol was a promising and lasting solution for rehabilitation of this type of tailings. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Inorganic pollution induced by smelting waste has threatened the safety of environment, whereas the impacts on farmlands with regards to potentially toxic elements (PTEs) receive insufficient attention. Herein, the contents, transfer pathways and potential risks of the PTEs in common crops were examined from different farmlands distributed around an indigenous Zn-smelting area in Guizhou, China. The results showed that Tl in cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.) (up to 3.74 mg/kg) and radish (Raphanus sativus L.) (up to 1.16 mg/kg) at some sites exceeded the maximum permissible level (MPL) (0.5 mg/kg) for food, and, under the same pollution condition, cabbage and radish were more likely to enrich PTEs, and the edible portion of maize was not prone to Tl risk. Hazard quotient calculations of Tl, Ba, and U were greater than 1, indicating the edible risk of crops for these PTEs. Further characterization of selected soils revealed that MnFe2O4 and Fe2O3 controlled the phase transformation of Tl(III) in rhizospheric soils. Furthermore, distinctive mullite was detected in the soil which confirmed the contribution of high temperature smelting to PTEs pollution. The findings indicate an emergent need for soil remediation around historical indigenous metal smelting areas for the sake of food security. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In this study, a novel slow release carrier for the controlled release of citric acid (CA), hydroxypropyl chitosan-graft-carboxymethyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPCS-g-CMCD) was synthesized by the grafting reaction of carboxymethyl-β-cyclodextrin (CMCD) with hydroxypropyl chitosan (HPCS), and the structural characteristics of HPCS-g-CMCD were confirmed by FT-IR, TGA, and NMR. Based on HPCS-g-CMCD and CA, slow release citric acid (SRCA) was prepared by a spray drying method. HPCS-g-CMCD carrier has a better slow release performance for CA compared to HPCS and CMCD, and CA release mechanism was attributed to a Fickian diffusion. Furthermore, the release behavior of uranium in contaminated soil could be effectively controlled by SRCA. The effects of SRCA on improving the phytoremediation capacity in uranium-contaminated soil were investigated using Brassica juncea, which were grown in pots containing soil with uranium at 56 mg kg−1. After 50 days of growth, 5 mmol kg−1 of CA, SRCA I, SRCA II, and SRCA III was applied, respectively. The results showed that slow release citric acid could enhance the uptake of uranium in Indian mustard. Uranium concentration in the root with SRCA I treatment was increased by 80.25% compared to the control, and the uranium removal efficiency of the SRCA I treatment was 1.66-fold greater than that of the control. Simultaneously, the leaching loss of uranium in SRCA I-treated soil was decreased by 37.35% compared to CA-treated soil. As a promising remediation strategy, SRCA-assisted phytoremediation may provide a kind of feasible technology with low leaching risk for remediation of uranium-contaminated soils. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The heavy metal contamination in the environment causes serious risk and long-term lethal effects to all living organisms due to their ability to show toxicity at low concentrations. The bio-magnification of heavy metals in the food chain is a matter of concern for public health. The persistent exposure to heavy metals such as mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), and uranium (U) cause several pathologic conditions in humans by interfering with normal cellular processes. Due to the non-biodegradable nature of these pollutants, they get accumulated for a long time in the soil. The removal of these pollutants by conventional methods is not satisfactory due to the high cost and generation of huge quantities of waste products. Hence, the use of micro-organisms is the most successful approach to remediate heavy metals from the environment due to their efficacy and financial viability. Numerous microorganisms have been employed to diminish the toxic effects of heavy metals. The combination of microorganisms and plants as a bioremediation strategy is another efficient method for heavy metal bioremediation. The chapter will summarize the heavy metal exploitation with a focus on Cd, As, Pb, and Chromium (Cr). It will also describe the various bioremediation techniques which are being used in the removal of these heavy metals from soil. © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Uranium pollution in tailings and its decay products is a global environmental problem. It is of great significance to use economical and efficient technologies to remediate uranium-contaminated soil. In this study, the effects of pH, temperature, and inoculation volume on stabilization efficiency and microbial community response of uranium tailings were investigated by a single-factor batch experiment in the remediation process by mixed sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB, Pantoea sp. grinm-12). The results showed that the optimal parameters of microbial stabilization by mixed SRB-PSB were pH of 5.0, temperature of 25°C, and inoculation volume of 10%. Under the optimal conditions, the uranium in uranium tailings presented a tendency to transform from the acid-soluble state to residual state. In addition, the introduction of exogenous SRB-PSB can significantly increase the richness and diversity of endogenous microorganisms, effectively maintain the reductive environment for the microbial stabilization system, and promote the growth of functional microorganisms, such as sulfate-reducing bacteria (Desulfosporosinus and Desulfovibrio) and iron-reducing bacteria (Geobacter and Sedimentibacter). Finally, PCoA and CCA analyses showed that temperature and inoculation volume had significant effects on microbial community structure, and the influence order of the three environmental factors is as follows: inoculation volume > temperature > pH. The outcomes of this study provide theoretical support for the control of uranium in uranium-contaminated sites. Copyright © 2021 Lv, Tang, Liu, Zhang, Chen, Hu, Chen and Zhu.},

	abstract = {It is sad to realize, but our time has become in the history of the Earth the time of the most drastic change (almost to the point of destruction) by mankind of the natural habitat. As a result of anthropogenic impact, thousands of species of saprophytic microorganisms, plants, and animals may disappear on the planet. This process must be stopped, because further reduction of biodiversity can lead to destabilization of ecosystems. Environmental pollution with heavy metals and radionuclides is one of the most important environmental problems of the late twentieth to early twenty-first centuries. As you know, many heavy metals pose a danger to living organisms due to their toxicity and mutagenicity; cleaning the environment from these compounds is now becoming increasingly important. The phenomenon of microbial heavy metal resistance has major importance and is crucial in microbial ecology, especially in processes of biogeochemical cycling of heavy metals and in the bioremediation of metal-contaminated ecological systems. A biological approach such as bioremediation offers significantly more advantages over conventional technology to reduce the content of heavy metals in the environment due to its less expensive and environmentally friendly nature (Feruke-Bello, J Bioremediation 22(1–2): 28–42, 2018). The bioremediation method is based on the activation of aboriginal soil microflora, as well as on the introduction, instead of pollution, of specially selected microorganisms that actively utilize the pollutant, which significantly accelerates the processes of soil restoration to the level of their economic, including agricultural use. This work presents an experimental study of the interaction of heavy metals and microorganisms in the soil, the possibility of using microorganisms for bioremediation of soils from pollution by xenobiotics, including heavy metals. The data on the selection of highly resistant strains of microorganisms to the effects of heavy metals in soils and their use for the detoxification of these elements for cleaning the natural environment are presented. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.},

	abstract = {Uranium contamination of soils and groundwater in the United States represents a significant health risk and will require multiple remediation approaches. Microbial phosphatase activity coupled to the addition of an organic P source has recently been studied as a remediation strategy that provides an extended release of inorganic P (Pi) into U-contaminated sites, resulting in the precipitation of meta-autunite minerals. Previous laboratory- A nd field-based biomineralization studies have investigated environments with relatively high U concentrations (>20 μM). However, most contaminated sites have much lower U concentrations (<2 μM). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limit for U in drinking water is 0.126 μM. Reaching this regulatory limit becomes challenging as U concentrations approach autunite solubility. We studied the precipitation of U(VI)-phosphate minerals by an environmental isolate of Caulobacter sp. (strain OR37) from an Oak Ridge, Tennessee, U-contaminated site. Abiotic U(VI) solubility experiments reveal that U(VI)-phosphate minerals do not form in the presence of excess Pi (500 μM) when U(VI) concentrations are <1 μM and pH is <5. When OR37 cells are reacted under the same conditions with Pi or glycerol-2-phosphate, U(VI)-phosphate mineral formation was observed, along with the formation of intracellular polyphosphate granules. These results show that bacteria provide supersaturated microenvironments needed for U(VI)-phosphate mineralization while hydrolyzing organic P sources. This provides a pathway to lower U concentrations to below EPA limits for drinking water. © 2021 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Understanding the hydro-biogeochemical conditions that impact the mobility of uranium (U) in natural or artificial wetlands is essential for the management of contaminated environments. Field-based research indicates that high organic matter content and saturation of the soil from the water table create favorable conditions for U accumulation. Despite the installation of artificial wetlands for U remediation, the processes that can release U from wetland soils to underlying aquifers are poorly understood. Here we used a large soil core from a montane wetland in a 6 year lysimeter experiment to study the stability of U accumulated to levels of up to 6000 ppm. Amendments with electron acceptors showed that the wetland soil can reduce sulfate and Fe(III) in large amounts without significant release of U into the soil pore water. However, amendment with carbonate (5 mM, pH 7.5) resulted in a large discharge of U. After a six-month period of imposed drought, the re-flooding of the core led to the release of negligible amounts of U into the pore water. This long-term experiment demonstrates that U is strongly bound to organic matter and that its stability is only challenged by carbonate complexation. © 2021},

	abstract = {A wide variety of pollutants such as heavy metals, organic, and inorganic wastes are continuously being added to the environmental components globally. These pollutants are stressing our environment and badly eroding the biotic components of our ecosystems. Besides this, these are hazardous to human health. Phytoremediation is a promising environment friendly technology that has gained attention of researchers across the globe from the past few decades. Phytoremediation (also known as “green remediation” and “botanical bioremediation”) utilizes plants to reduce, remove, degrade, or immobilize environmental toxins, primarily those of anthropogenic origin aiming at restoring polluted sites to a condition useable for private or public applications. Some of the heavy metals and pollutants such as lead, chromium, cadmium, copper, nickel, mercury, zinc, strontium, boron, selenium, arsenic, thallium, uranium, calcium, cobalt, manganese, nitrates, herbicides, and chlorinated compounds are highly toxic and lethal even in trace amounts which may be teratogenic, mutagenic, endocrine disruptive as well as behavioral and neurotoxic in nature. With ever-increasing urbanization and advancement in technology, the addition of pollutants is expected to continue by many folds. Phytoremediation has been found effective in remedying the high concentration of these pollutants from the soil and groundwater. Some plant species have interestingly been found effective in absorbing radioactive and toxic elements from air as well. The concept of phytoremediation was well-known, and various plants are being used by the Neanderthal man for wastewater treatment from thousand years ago. Some of the species such as Avena sativa, Brassica juncea, B. napus, Hordeum vulgare, Panicum virgatum, Thlaspi caerulescens, and Viola calaminaria have successfully been used to absorb environmental pollutants. From the past decade, several methods of phytoremediation like phytoextraction/phytoaccumulation, phytotransformation, phytostabilization, phytostimulation, phytorhizodegradation, phytodegradation, and phytovolatilization have been under investigation. Besides, the role of different factors that affect phytoremediation such as EDTA, CDTA, DTPA, EDDS, NTA, HEDTA, EGTA, and citric acid have also been studied by various researchers globally. This chapter is an endeavor to provide a comprehensive overview on all aforementioned aspects of phytoremediation along with future prospects of this technology. In addition, limitations and advantages of the said technique are also discussed in detail that would help the readers to find answers to various questions pertaining to this potential technique. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.},

	abstract = {Radiological aspects such as natural radioactivity of 238U, 232Th, 226Ra, 40K combined with potentially toxic metal(loid) (PTM) distribution features were seldom simultaneously investigated in rare earth element (REE) processing activities. This work was designed to investigate the distribution levels of natural radioactivity, air-absorbed dose rate of γ radiation as well as PTMs at a typical REE plant in Guangdong, China. Ambient soils around REE processing facilities were sampled, measured and assessed. The natural radioactivity of radionuclides of the samples was determined using a high-purity germanium γ-energy spectrometer while the air-absorbed dose rate of γ radiation was measured at a height of 1 m above the ground using a portable radiometric detector. The PTM content was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results showed that the specific activities of the radionuclides ranged from 80.8 to 1990.2, 68.2 to 6935.0, 78.4 to 14,372.4, and 625.4 to 2698.4 Bq·kg−1 for 238U, 226Ra, 232Th, and 40K, respectively, representing overwhelmingly higher activity concentrations than worldwide soil average natural radioactivity. The radium equivalent activity and external hazard index of most samples exceeded the limits of 370 Bq·kg−1 and 1, respectively. The measured air-absorbed dose rate of γ radiation was in a range of 113~4004 nGy·h−1, with most sites displaying comparatively higher values than that from some other REE-associated industrial sites referenced. The content levels of PTMs of Cu, Ni, Zn, Mn, Pb, Cd, Cr, and As were 0.7~37.2, 1.8~16.9, 20.4~2070.5, 39.4~431.3, 2.3~1411.5, 0.1~0.7, 6.7~526.1, and 59.5~263.8 mg·kg−1, respectively. It is important to note that the PTM contents in the studied soil samples were 2.1~5.4 times higher for Zn-As and 1.4 times higher for Pb than the third level of the China soil standard while 2.5~13 times higher for Zn-As and 1.2 times higher for Pb than Canadian industry standard. The findings call for subsequent site remediation to secure the ecological environment and human health after the REE processing plant was decommissioned. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The carriage of both, heavy metal and antibiotic resistance appears to be a common trait in bacterial communities native to long-term contaminated habitats, including the Savannah River Site (SRS). There is widespread soil contamination at the SRS; a United States Department of Energy (DOE) facility with long-term contamination from past industrial and nuclear weapons production activities. To further evaluate the genomic and metabolic traits that underpin metal and antibiotic resistance, a robust mercury (Hg) and uranium (U)-resistant strain- SRS-8-S-2018, was isolated. Minimum inhibitory concentration of this strain revealed resistance to Hg (10 μg/ml) and U (5 mM), the two main heavy metal contaminants at the SRS. Metabolic assessment of strain SRS-8-S-2018 using Biolog metabolic fingerprinting analysis revealed preference for carbohydrate utilization followed by polymers, amino acids, carboxy acids, and esters; this physiological activity diminished when Hg stress was provided at 1 and 3 μg/ml and completely ceased at 5 μg/ml Hg, indicating that continued release of Hg will have negative metabolic impacts to even those microorganisms that possess high resistance ability. Development of antibiotic resistance in strain SRS-8-S-2018 was evaluated at a functional level using phenomics, which confirmed broad resistance against 70.8% of the 48 antibiotics tested. Evolutionary and adaptive traits of strain SRS-8-S-2018 were further assessed using genomics, which revealed the strain to taxonomically affiliate with Serratia marcescens species, possessing a genome size of 5,323,630 bp, 5,261 proteins (CDS), 55 genes for transfer RNA (tRNA), and an average G + C content of 59.48. Comparative genomics with closest taxonomic relatives revealed 360 distinct genes in SRS-8-S-2018, with multiple functions related to both, antibiotic and heavy metal resistance, which likely facilitates the strain’s survival in a metalliferous soil habitat.

	abstract = {Post phytoremediation accumulation of heavy metals in plants is causing an environmental issue worldwide. In this study, we investigated the ability of eight different kinds of microorganisms to degrade and release heavy metals from heavy metal enriched ryegrass, including 5 species of bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus pumilus-I, Bacillus pumilus-II and Bacillus cereus) and 3 of fungi (Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Trichoderma ressei and Pterula sp. strain QD-1), by growing them under uranium stress and assessing their ability to degrade biomass. After 30 days, the degradation ability of fungi was found better than that of bacteria, while the metal leaching ability of bacteria was found better. The highest degradation rate (upto 60%) was obtained by using P. chrysosporium, Pterula sp. strain QD-1 exhibited the best leaching rate for uranium (upto 77%). The overall degradation rate of lignin and cellulose and hemicellulose was found lower (40% and 60%, respectively). According to the antagonistic characteristics of microbes, we combined different dominant species, in which under optimal conditions the T2 combination (P. chrysosporium, T. reesei, and Pterula sp. strain QD-1 and B. subtilis) was able to degrade 80% of the ryegrass, 51% of lignin, 74% of cellulose and hemicellulose, releasing 78% of U, 90% of Pb and the releasing rate of other heavy metals was more than 95%. FTIR analysis showed the least degradation of lignin, while SEM-EDX analysis of the degradation residues displayed the microstructure of ryegrass being greatly damaged. Only a small amount of U was found in the residues of the researched combinations. This study provides efficient Microbial Combined Degradation Technology for heavy metal enriched biomass, which can effectively deal with heavy metal enriched plants, and provide a basis for the recovery and utilization of heavy metals, avoiding secondary pollution in the environment caused by this type of biomass. © 2020 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Natural biopolymers have gained remarkable attention for bioremediation particularly in heavy metal removal and oil degradation due to their non-toxic nature and lack of secondary pollution. The exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced by the bacteria have become an important class of biopolymers that are employed in bioremediation. The bacteria isolated from the rhizospheric soil have higher metal tolerance and their EPS are effective in biosorption of heavy metals. Here, we report the characterization of an EPS (EPS-RN5) isolated from the root nodule-associated bacteria, Enterobacter cancerogenus strain YU16-RN5 and its heavy metal biosorption abilities. The bacteria isolated from the West coast of India was cultured in yeast extract mannitol (YEM) medium for EPS extraction and to study the production kinetics on a temporal scale. The biochemical composition, rheological properties and thermostability of EPS-RN5 was characterized by standard methods. The biosorption potential of EPS-RN5 against the selected heavy metals was analyzed by employing the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) technique. Further, cell culture experiments were used to test the role of EPS-RN5 in reducing the cytotoxicity exerted by the heavy metals in vitro using a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK 293T). The bacteria showed good growth in YEM media and the maximum EPS yield was 1800 mg/L at 96 h. The molecular weight of EPS-RN5 was 0.7 × 106 Da and it contained 61.5% total sugars and 14.5% proteins. The monosaccharide composition of the EPS included glucose, sorbose and galactose in the ratio 0.25:0.07:1.0. The EPS-RN5 showed high thermal stability with a degradation temperature of 273 °C. Rheological analysis revealed the non-Newtonian behavior, with pseudoplastic characteristics. The EPS-RN5 efficiently absorbed cadmium and other heavy metals such as mercury, strontium, copper, arsenic, and uranium. In vitro studies revealed significant protective effect against the cadmium-induced cytotoxicity in HEK 293T cells. These results indicate the potential applications of EPS-RN5. © 2021, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.},

	abstract = {This study is part of the ongoing environmental monitoring program of the abandoned Mecsek uranium mine during the remediation period. During this program on the recultivated No.1 spoil bank, the radioactivity and the potentially toxic element (PTE) contents in the covering soil had shown some anomalies which refers to possible migration alongside the slope. Therefore, in a previous study, soil and plant samples were collected from top to bottom position of the slope and the total element content was determined by multi-elemental inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. The results have indicated that there was a high possibility for PTEs to be mobile and available for uptake by plants. To confirm this indication in the present study for the soil samples the BCR sequential extraction procedure was applied to characterise the environmental mobility of PTEs, and it was compared with soil pH and cation exchange capacity (CEC). The results indicated that the ratio of Cd, Co, Mn, Pb, and U in the non-residual fractions ranged between 36.8 to 100 % and increased from top to bottom direction. The comparison showed that the samples with the lowest pH and CEC had the most mobility of the PTEs. The distribution of U, Cd, Mn, Co, and Pb in fractions indicated that some parts of the spoil deposit require additional steps to hinder the migration through the covering soil layer, and the BCR sequential extraction procedure has proven to be useful in providing information for the planning and management of remediation operations. © 2021 Lamlile Khumalo et al., published by Sciendo.},

	abstract = {Microbial remediation of heavy metals in soil has been widely studied. However, bioremediation efficiency is limited in practical applications because of nutritional deficiency, low efficiency, and competition with indigenous microorganisms. Herein, we prepared a biochar-based microbial agent (BMA) by immobilizing the microbial agent (MA, containing Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and Citrobacter sp.) on biochar for the remediation of U and Cd in soil. The results showed that BMA increased soil organic matter, cation exchange capacity, and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis activity and dehydrogenase activity by 58.7%, 38.2%, 42.9%, and 51.1%. The availability of U and Cd were significantly decreased by 67.4% and 54.2% in BMA amended soil, thereby reducing their accumulation in vegetables. BMA greatly promoted vegetable growth. Additionally, BMA significantly altered the structure and function of rhizosphere soil microbial communities. Coincidently, more abundant ecologically beneficial bacteria like Nitrospira, Nitrosomonas, Lysobacter, and Bacillus were observed, whereas plant pathogenic fungi like Fusarium and Alternaria reduced in BMA amended soil. The network analysis revealed that BMA amendment increased the tightness and complexity of microbial communities. Importantly, the compatibility of niches and microbial species within co-occurrence network was enhanced after BMA addition. These findings provide a promising strategy for suppressing heavy metal accumulation in vegetables and promoting their growth. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Radium-226, an alpha emitter with half-life 1600 years, is ubiquitous in natural environments. Present in rocks and soils, it is also absorbed by vegetation. The efficiency of 226Ra uptake by plants from the soil is important to assess for the study of heavy metals uptake by plants, monitoring of radioactive pollution, and the biogeochemical cycle of radium in the Critical Zone. Using a thoroughly validated measurement method of effective 226Ra concentration (ECRa) in the laboratory, we compare ECRa values of the plant to that of the closest soil, and we infer the 226Ra soil-to-plant transfer ratio, RSP, for a total of 108 plant samples collected in various locations in France. ECRa values of plants range over five orders of magnitude with mean (min–max) of 1.66 ± 0.03 (0.020–113) Bq kg−1. Inferred RSP values range over four orders of magnitude with mean (min–max) of 0.0188 ± 0.0004 (0.00069–0.37). The mean RSP value of plants in granitic and metamorphic context (0.073 ± 0.002; n = 50) is significantly higher (12 ± 1 times) than that of plants in calcareous and sedimentary context (0.0058 ± 0.0002; n = 58). This difference, which cannot be attributed to a systematic difference in emanation coefficient, is likely due to the competition between calcium and radium. In a given substratum context, the compartments of a given plant species show coherent and decreasing RSP values in the following order (acropetal gradient): roots > bark > branches and stems ≈ leaves. Oak trees (Quercus genus) concentrate 226Ra more than other trees and plants in this set. While this study clearly demonstrates the influence of substratum on the 226Ra uptake by plants in non-contaminated areas, our measurement method appears as a promising practical tool to use for (phyto)remediation and its monitoring in uranium- and radium-contaminated areas. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {One of the more concerning issues in the world today is that radioactive uranium contaminates the soil and threatens the organisms. The focus of contaminated soil remediation is to immobilize the uranium in the soil and reduce its leaching. Nano-hydroxyapatite (nHAP) and nano-hydroxyapatite/nano-zero-valent iron mixture (nHAP/nZVI) are used as immobilizer to remediate uranium-contaminated soil. The leaching characteristics and morphological changes of uranium before and after immobilization were studied by using Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) and Tessier stepwise chemical extraction method. The results show that the leaching concentration of uranium in the soil was 0.005 mg/L when nHAP was added alone, and the leaching rate was 9.14%. The leaching concentration of uranium in the soil was only 0.004 mg/L when adding nHAP/nZVI, and the leaching rate was reduced to 8.57%. U (VI) not only reacts with nHAP to form a stable complex but also is reduced by nZVI to insoluble U (IV) when nHAP/nZVI is added. As a result, both nHAP/nZVI and nHAP can effectively immobilize uranium in the soil, and nHAP/nZVI can better promote the immobilization of the uranium in the soil.

	abstract = {Rapid industrialization and urbanization have resulted in elevated concentrations of contaminants in the groundwaters and subsurface soils, posing a growing hazard to humans and ecosystems. The transformation of most contaminants is closely linked to the mineralogy of ferric (hydr)oxides. Sulfidation of ferric (hydr)oxides is one of the most significant biogeochemical reactions in the anoxic environments, causing reductive dissolution and recrystallization of ferric (hydr)oxides and further affecting the transformation of iron-associated contaminants. This paper provides a comprehensive review on the sulfidation process of ferric (hydr)oxides and the transformation of relevant contaminants. This review presents detailed reaction mechanisms between ferric (hydr)oxides and dissolved sulfide, and elucidates the factors (e.g. crystallinity of ferric (hydr)oxides, the ratio of sulfide concentration to the surface area concentration of ferric (hydr)oxides) that control the formation of surface associated Fe(II), iron sulfide minerals, as well as transformation of secondary minerals. Then, we summarized the transformation mechanisms of a variety of typical environmentally relevant contaminants existing in groundwater and subsurface soils, including heavy metals, metal(loid) oxyanions (arsenic, antimony, chromium), radionuclides (uranium, technetium), organic contaminants and phosphate/nitrate species. The general mechanisms of contaminant transformation involve a combination of release, reduction and re-adsorption/incorporation processes, the specific pathway of which is highly dependent on the properties of the contaminant itself and the extent of sulfidation. Moreover, the challenge of extending our knowledge towards in situ remediation, as well as further research needs are identified. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Environmental contamination caused by uranium mining is becoming a worldwide issue due to its negative impact on the environment. The aim of this study is to evaluate the contamination levels of riparian forest stands and their interaction with pollutants on the example of two localities with long and short-term uranium mining closure. Notably high Cu content, which exceeded the lower range of the toxicity limit in 50-75% of the cases, was detected in the leaves. Increased U content also represents a potential risk. As both of the elements have a negative effect particularly on the root system, it can be assumed that the soil-stabilizing and water erosion-reducing functions of the stands may be reduced. Extremely high U content (51.8 mg/kg DA) in the leaves of Aesculus hippocastanum L. indicates its potential for phytoremediation. Significantly higher U content determined at the locality with the long-term closure of mining was probably caused by the instauration of the shallow hydrogeological circulation after mine inundation. Strong correlation between U and Pb suggests identical trend of their uptake and accumulation by plants. A significant dependence of the level of contamination on the distance from its source was not demonstrated. Therefore, the management of mining areas should focus on the protection of riparian forest, which can through its stabilizing and erosion-reducing functions and through suitable species composition effectively prevent spreading of contamination. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The failure of uranium mine tailings dams results in the infiltration and spreading of tailings in the subsurface. The fate and transport of radionuclides in the subsurface depends on several confounding, complex interdependent factors that describe the elements of the integrated system (i.e., meteorological; hydrological; hydrogeological; and, soil, groundwater, and mine tailings chemistry). The factors describing the integrated system have typically been investigated independently; however, their interdependence and resulting collective influence on the subsurface migration of radionuclides are yet to be explored. The current study develops a complex network theoretical approach to analyze these interdependencies. In this respect, a network of factors (NoF) was developed, and its characteristics (e.g., diameter, density, characteristic pathlength, average clustering coefficient, and factor centrality measures) were evaluated to determine the importance of considering these interdependencies when developing radionuclide fate and transport models. A sensitivity analysis was subsequently performed on the NoF to characterize the propagation of uncertainty associated with the factors in the NoF through a fate and transport model. The sensitivity analysis indicated that microorganisms present in the soil and mine tailings, fraction of organic carbon in the soil matrix, infiltration, and transmissivity must be well characterized (i.e., to minimize their uncertainty) when developing an integrated subsurface radionuclide fate and transport model, as uncertainty in these parameters will be amplified in the model output. The NoF developed in this study can be used to allocate data collection resources strategically in order to minimizing uncertainty in fate and transport models. This improves the reliability of fate and transport models, and ultimately leads to better management and remediation strategies to mitigate impacts from UMTD failures. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The chitosan-modified biochar composite, as a carbohydrate polymer, has received increasing attention and becomes a research hotspot. It is a promising impurity adsorption material, which has potential application value in the agricultural environment fields such as soil improvement and sewage purification. The composite can combine the advantages of biochar with chitosan, and the resulting composite usually exhibits a great improvement in its surface functional groups, adsorption sites, stability, and adsorption properties. In addition, compared to other adsorbents, the composite truly achieves the concept of “waste control by waste”. In this paper, the preparation method, composite classification, adsorption mechanism, and models of biochar modified by chitosan are introduced, meanwhile, we also review and summarize their effects on the decontamination of wastewater and soil. In addition to common heavy metal ions, we also review the adsorption and removal of some other organic/inorganic pollutants, including (1) drug residues; (2) dyes; (3) phosphates; (4) radionuclides; (5) perfluorochemicals, etc. Moreover, challenges and prospects for the composite are presented and further studies are called for the chitosan-biochar composite.

	abstract = {Heavy metal pollution in the environment compromises environmental quality and human health. Phytoremediation is an innovative, green, and affordable technique that uses plants for the removal of contaminants from soil and water. Finding suitable plants that can adequately remove heavy metals from both soil and water has been a research hotspot in recent years, and there has been a rapid development in research on the use of high biomass producing crops for this purpose. Vetiver grass and Indian mustard have emerged as plants that are effective for phytoremediation and can serve other purposes during and after their use in phytoremediation. These plants are applicable in many areas because they can tolerate varied climatic conditions, thrive on degraded lands and contaminated water bodies, are easy to cultivate, and produce high biomass. This review article evaluates the phytoremediation potential of vetiver grass and Indian mustard by providing a synthesis of studies that have investigated their use for this purpose. The review considered research articles from the past 21 years and highlights the status and possible advancements in the efficient use of these plants for the remediation of heavy metal–contaminated sites. This work is of importance because phytoremediation is still undergoing immense research to promote its applicability and acceptability. Thus, it gives information on two important plants that are very useful for phytoremediation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The dissolution behavior of U, contained in the soils, was examined through chlorination with ZrCl4 to reduce the U concentration to clearance levels. Natural soils, composed of Si, Al, and approximately 2 ppm U, acted as surrogates for the contaminated soils. A salt mixture of LiCl-KCl-ZrCl4 was prepared in an Al2O3 crucible at 500°C, and SiO2 or natural soils were loaded for the chemical reactions. The reaction of SiO2 and Al2O3 with ZrCl4 was monitored by cyclic voltammetry, and no obvious change was observed. The results showed that SiO2 and Al2O3 were stable against ZrCl4. The reaction of natural soils with ZrCl4 indicated that the U content decreased from 2 to 1.2 ppm, while ∼0.4 ppm U appeared in the salt. Thus, the U, in the soils, dissolved into the salt by chlorination with ZrCl4. Therefore, based on these results, a new method to remediate U-contaminated soil wastes by chlorination with ZrCl4, followed by electrorefining of U, is suggested.  © 2021 Junhyuk Jang et al.},

	abstract = {Hunters Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco, California was deemed a Superfund site by the USEPA in 1989 due to chemical and radiological contamination resulting from U.S. Navy operations from 1939 to 1974. During characterization and remediation efforts, over 50,000 radiological soil samples and 19,000 air samples were collected. This risk assessment, conducted in accordance with federal guidelines, represents the first comprehensive evaluation of past, present, and future health risks associated with radionuclides present at the site. The assessment indicated that before site remediation, most radionuclide soil concentrations were at or near local background concentrations. Had such low remedial goals not been established, significant remediation of surface soils would not have been necessary to protect human health. The pre-remediation lifetime incremental cancer morbidity risks for on-site workers and theoretical on-site residents due to radionuclide contamination were found to be 1.3 × 10−6 and 3.2 × 10−6, respectively. The post-remediation risks to future on-site residents were found to be 6.3 × 10−8 (without durable cover) and 3.7 × 10−8 (with durable cover), while post-remediation risks to on-site workers were found to be 2.6 × 10−8 (without durable cover) and 1.6 × 10−8 (with durable cover). Risk estimates for all scenarios were found to be significantly below the acceptable risk of 3 × 10−4 approved by regulatory agencies. Upwind and downwind air samples collected during remediation indicate that remediation activities never posed a measurable risk to off-site residents. This risk assessment emphasizes the importance of establishing clear and scientifically rigorous soil remedial goals at sites as well as understanding local radionuclide background concentrations. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Uranium uptake, translocation and its effects on leaf anatomy in vetiver grass (Vetiveria zizanioides L. Nash) grown in hydroponics were investigated at a wide range of concentrations. At concentrations below 200 ppm (1, 5, 25, 100, and 200 ppm) almost 90–95% of uranium was depleted from the medium within 3 days of treatment, while at other concentrations viz., at 318, 500, 619, 1,000, 5,000, 7,500, and 11,900 ppm, it reached a maximum between 7 and 14 days, with a marginal increase in the depletion thereafter. Most of the uranium could be recovered from plants at concentrations below 200 ppm. On the contrary, a significant reduction in the recovery of uranium was noticed at higher concentrations and the percentage of recovery dropped from 82% at 318 ppm to 35% at 11,900 ppm. While most of the uranium taken up by the plants could be recovered from roots at lower concentrations, a preferential translocation of the element to shoot occurred at concentrations beyond 1,000 ppm. Histological studies of leaves from plants treated with 1,000 ppm uranium displayed the formation of multilayered cells between the epidermis and vascular bundles on the adaxial side in the distal regions of the leaves. The plants were also found to tolerate and survive the radiological and chemical constituents of both uranium mill tailings soil as well as various effluents of uranium mine and mill operations. Further, they could also survive in uranium ore containing 600 ppm of triuranium octoxide (U3O8) and could withstand the amendment of ore with citric acid. The ability of vetiver to take up uranium from solutions to high levels and its survival in effluents, mill tailings soil, and ore coupled with its ecological characteristics makes it an ideal plant for phytoextraction of uranium. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Massive stockpiles of uranium (U) mine tailings have resulted in soil contamination with U. Plants for soil remediation have low extraction efficiency of U. Chelating agents can mobilize U in soils and, hence, enhance phytoextraction of U from the soil. However, the rapid mobilization rate of soil U by chelating agents in a short period than plant uptake rate could increase the risk of groundwater contamination with soluble U leaching down the soil profile. This review summarizes recent progresses in synthesis and application of chelating agents for assisting phytoremediation of U-contaminated soils. In detail, the interactions between chelating agents and U ions are initially elucidated. Subsequently, the mechanisms of phytoextraction and effectiveness of different chelating agents for phytoremediation of U-contaminated soils are given. Moreover, the potential risks associated with chelating agents are discussed. Finally, the synthesis and application of slow-release chelating agents for slowing down metal mobilization in soils are presented. The application of slow-release chelating agents for enhancing phytoextraction of soil U is still scarce. Hence, we propose the preparation of slow-release biodegradable chelating agents, which can control the release speed of chelating agent into the soil in order to match the mobilization rate of soil U with plant uptake rate, while diminishing the risk of residual chelating agent leaching to groundwater. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Uranium (U) is a naturally occurring metal; its environmental levels can be increased due to processes in the nuclear industry and fertilizer production. The transfer of U in the food chain from plants is associated with deleterious chemical and radiation effects. To date, limited information is available about U toxicity on plant physiology. This study investigates the responses of metal-accumulating plants to different concentrations of U. The plants Noccaea caerulescens and Noccaea goesingense are known as metal hyperaccumulators and therefore could serve as candidates for the phytoremediation of radioactive hotspots; Plantago major is a widely used pharmaceutical plant that pioneers polluted grounds and therefore should not contain high concentrations of toxic elements. The experimental plants were grown hydroponically at U concentrations between 1 μM and 10 mM. The content of U and essential elements was analyzed in roots and leaves by ICP-MS. The amount of accumulated U was influenced by its concentration in the hydroponics. Roots contained most of the metal, whereas less was transported up to the leaves, with the exception of N. goesingense in a medium concentration of U. U also influenced the nutrient profile of the plants. We localized the U in plant tissues using EDX in the SEM. U was evenly distributed in roots and leaves of Noccaea species, with one exception in the roots of N. goesingense, where the central cylinder contained more U than the cortex. The toxicity of U was assessed by measuring growth and photosynthetic parameters. While root biomass of N. caerulescens was not affected by U, root biomass of N. goesingense decreased significantly at high U concentrations of 0.1 and 10 mM and root biomass of P. major decreased at 10 mM U. Dry weight of leaves was decreased at different U concentrations in the three plant species; a promotive effect was observed in N. caerulescens at lowest concentration offered. Chlorophyll a fluorescence was not affected or negatively affected by U in both Noccaea species, whereas in Plantago also positive effects were observed. Our results show that the impact of U on Plantago and Noccaea relates to its external concentration and to the plant species. When growing in contaminated areas, P. major should not be used for medicinal purpose. Noccaea species and P. major could immobilize U in their rhizosphere in hotspots contaminated by U, and they could extract limited amounts of U into their leaves. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Recently, they have attracted increasing attention because of their potential role in environmental bioremediation. Although siderophores are generally considered to exhibit high specificity for iron, they have also been reported to bind to various metal and metalloid ions. This unique ability allows siderophores to solubilise and mobilise heavy metals and metalloids from soil, thereby facilitating their bioremediation. In addition, because of their redox nature, they can mediate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and thus promote the biodegradation of organic contaminants. The aim of this review is to summarise the existing knowledge on the developed strategies of siderophore-assisted bioremediation of metals, metalloids, and organic contaminants. Additionally, this review also includes the biosynthesis and classification of microbial and plant siderophores. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) was planted in uranium-contaminated soil mixtures supplemented with different amounts of citric acid to investigate the defense strategies of perennial ryegrass against U and the enhanced mechanism of citric acid on the remediation efficiency in the laboratory. The uranium content in the plant tissues showed that the roots were the predominant tissue for uranium accumulation. In both root and shoot cells, the majority of U was located in the cell wall fraction. Furthermore, antioxidant enzymes were also stimulated when exposed to U stress. These results suggested that perennial ryegrass had evolved defense strategies, such as U sequestration in root tissue, compartmentalization in the cell wall, and antioxidant enzyme systems, to minimize uranium stress. For an enhanced mechanism, the optimal concentration of citric acid was 5 mmol/kg, and the removal efficiency of U in the shoots and roots increased by 47.37% and 30.10%, respectively. The treatment with 5 mmol/kg citric acid had the highest contents of photosynthetic pigment and soluble protein, the highest activity of antioxidant enzymes, and the lowest content of MDA (malondialdehyde) and relative electrical conductivity. Moreover, the TEM (transmission electron microscope) results revealed that after 5 mmol/kg citric acid was added, the cell structure of plant branches partially returned to normal, the number of mitochondria increased, chloroplast surfaces seemed normal, and the cell wall became visible. The damage to the cell ultrastructure of perennial ryegrass was significantly alleviated by treatment with 5 mmol/kg citric acid. All the results above indicated that perennial ryegrass could accumulate uranium with elevated uranium tolerance and enrichment ability with 5 mmol/kg citric acid. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Uranium mill tailings (UMTs) are one critical source of environmental U pollution. Leaching test has been extensively used to reveal U release capacity and mechanism from UMTs, while little attention has been paid to the effects of re-adsorption process on U release. In this study, the role of U re-adsorption behaviors during leaching test with UMTs was comprehensively investigated. Through paired data on mineralogical composition and aqueous U speciation, the influence of environmentally relevant factors on U re-absorption capacity and mechanism on UMTs with different particle sizes was revealed. Significant amounts of U re-adsorption were observed and primarily attributed to the adsorption on chlorite, albite and muscovite as well as combined reduction-sequestration by muscovite. Uranium re-adsorption predominantly occurred via inner-sphere complexation and surface precipitation depending on leachant pH. Coexisting sulfate or phosphate could further enhance U re-adsorption. The enhanced re-adsorption from sulfate occurred when inner-sphere complexation governed the re-adsorption process. These findings suggest that the environmental hazards and ecological risks of the U containing (waste) solids might have been underestimated due to the ignorance of the re-adsorption process, since the re-adsorbed U could be easily re-mobilized. The insights from this study are also helpful in developing effective in-situ remediation strategies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

The effects of natural radionuclides on the topsoil microbial communities in anomalous natural radiation area were investigated in this work, and it was found that microbial community composition was significantly influenced by the specific-activities of natural radionuclides. The results revealed that relative abundances of 10 major microbial phyla and genera displayed different patterns along specific-activity gradients, including decreasing, increasing, hump-shaped, U-shaped, and similar sinusoidal or cosine wave trends, which indicated that the natural radionuclides were the predominant driver for change of microbial community structure. At the phylum and genus level, microbial communities were divided into two special groups according to the tolerance to natural radionuclides, such as 238U and 232Th, including tolerant and sensitive groups. Taken together, our findings suggest that the high specific-activities of natural radionuclides can obviously drive changes in microbial communities, providing a possibility for future studies on the microbial tolerance genes and bioremediation strains. © 2022 The Authors},

The analysis of kinetic adsorption data educed that the adsorption process followed the pseudo-second-order model and reached equilibrium in just 16 min. XPS analysis indicated that phosphate and amine functional groups play a vital role in the complexation between the phos-PDA shell and U (VI). In addition, actual soil remediation experiments indicated that the h-Fe3O4 @phos-PDA nanocomposite could reduce the radiation intensity of α-ray in uranium-contaminated soil by about 82.3%, demonstrating its great engineering application potential. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.},

Reference EXAFS data of model laboratory-prepared uranium compounds ('standards') are necessary to analyze U-contaminated samples from nuclear legacy sites. To minimize errors associated with measurements on different synchrotrons, it is important not only to compare data obtained on environmentally contaminated samples with the literature but also with 'standards' collected at the same beamline. Before recording the EXAFS spectra, all reference compounds were thoroughly characterized by Raman spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction. The U(VI) local molecular environments in the reference compounds, i.e. uranyl oxyhydroxides, phosphates, carbonates and uranates, were examined using XAFS. Based on the EXAFS fitting results obtained, including the nature of the bonding, interatomic distances and coordination numbers, parameters that are typical for a particular U compound were differentiated. Using data for 'standards', U speciation in the sample of radioactively contaminated soil was determined to be a mixture of U oxyhydroxide and carbonate phases. © 2022 International Union of Crystallography.

	abstract = {Plant growth regulators (PGRs) are widely used in agricultural activities and have the potential to improve plant growth and plant tolerance against metal stress. PGR-assisted phytoextraction is now an effective and inexpensive method for enhancing the plant removal of toxic metals from soil. In this study, we conducted experiments to determine the effects of PGR treatments on soil uranium (U) and cadmium (Cd) removal by sunflowers as well as their stress response to U and Cd contamination. We found that the plant growth was inhibited by combined U and Cd stress in sunflowers compared with that of the control; however, the application of exogenous PGR had reduced the combined U and Cd stress by stimulating photosynthesis, decreasing the levels of active oxygen and lipid peroxidation, and enhancing the activity of the antioxidant defence systems. Exogenous PGR also increased the uptake of U and Cd by sunflowers and therefore, improved their U and Cd remediation efficiency. Moreover, indoleacetic acid (IAA) was the most effective PGR at removing U and Cd in the soil; the U and Cd removal efficiency was 484.21% and 238.85% higher in the 500 mg L−1 IAA application compared with that of the control without PGR application, respectively. Furthermore, none of the PGR treatments significantly influenced the available U and Cd contents in soil. Our results, therefore, may provide some detailed understanding on the technologies for the sustainable remediation of U and Cd contaminated soil by the combination of PGR treatments and phytoextraction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study detected modest radioactive contamination at Olympic venues in Japan, and found significant alpha-, beta-, and gamma-emitter contamination at Japan's National Training Center. A total of 146 independent soil and dust samples were collected from sites in Fukushima Prefecture, Greater Tokyo, and the heavily traveled corridors between these northern Japan locations to assess radiological contamination related to the Fukushima meltdowns. Thirty-six samples were collected from 2020 Olympic/Paralympic venues, including Yoyogi National Stadium, Shiokaze Park, Olympic Village, Imperial Palace Gardens (all in Tokyo), Azuma Stadium in Fukushima, and the J-Village Olympic and Paralympic National Training Center. Samples were analyzed for beta activity and alpha activity per unit area (Bq/cm2), supplemented by gamma and alpha spectroscopy, with scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. Mean beta activity was two orders of magnitude greater than mean alpha activity, 459 ± 36 net Becquerel per square meter (Bq/m2) versus 5.20 ± 2.00 Bq/m2, respectively. Alpha and beta activities were not correlated, with a Pearson product moment correlation coefficient (RSQ) of 0.063. Greater Tokyo Olympic venues showed activities similar to those in the USA control set. In contrast to the Tokyo venues, the mean beta activity for J-Village Training Center samples was 2.4 times higher than for the Greater Tokyo samples. Azuma Park, the Fukushima Baseball venue, was 1.6 times higher than Greater Tokyo venues. The overall Northern Japan sample set displayed an average of 7.0 times greater beta activity than the Tokyo Olympic venues, evidencing the relative success of remediation at Olympic/Paralympic venues compared with other parts of Japan.  © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.},

	abstract = {Bovington Camp has been a main training area for armoured vehicles since 1916. Over the years, this has resulted in the erosion and mobilisation of soil particles into watercourses draining the area. Sediment-rich water from a main tributary, the Bovington Stream, discolours the River Frome during high flows. Regulatory agencies and angling groups were concerned that the quality of the river was being affected by run-off from the military ranges. Macroinvertebrate communities were studied between 1998 and 2016 at two sites on the Bovington Stream above and below a sediment trapping pond and two sites on the River Frome above and below the confluence. Samples were collected in Spring and Autumn and ecological quality was assessed using the River Invertebrate Classification Tool (RICT). There were marked increases in the ecological quality of the Bovington sites over time with most change occurring in the period 1998 to 2004. The two Frome sites were consistently classed as high quality throughout the study period. Increases in taxon richness between 1998–2004 and 2011–2016 were significant in the Bovington Stream but no change was observed in the River Frome. Faunal abundance at all sites fluctuated but there were no significant trends. The Combined Fine Sediment Index (CoFSI), assesses the impact of fine sediment pressure on the macroinvertebrate community. Low CoFSI scores were recorded in the early years of the study (1998–2000) at both Bovington sites but showed a steady increase until around 2010–2011, suggesting a degree of improvement/recovery from fine sediment pressure. No similar changes in CoFSI scores occurred in the River Frome. In the absence of any major disturbances in the Bovington catchment other than sediment remediation we conclude that the observed ‘improvements’ in the Bovington Stream are in large part due to the sediment control measures (sediment trapping and diversion) implemented since 1998. The project has shown how relatively simple sediment control strategies can improve ecological quality and has provided information on long-term faunal responses which can help managers plan the extent and timing of effective mitigation measures. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Mid-20th century mining in Naabeehó Bináhásdzo (Navajo Nation) polluted soil and groundwater with uranium and arsenic. The Diné and other indigenous residents of this region use groundwater for drinking, livestock, and irrigation, creating a serious environmental health risk. Currently, many individuals and communities on the Navajo Nation must purchase and transport treated water from hours away. Sunflowers (Helianthus annuus) preferentially take up uranium and arsenic, potentially representing a tool to remove these contaminants through on-site, low-cost phytoremediation. This study reports the results of a collaboration among researchers, high school students, teachers, and tribal leaders to analyze water chemistry and perform a phytoremediation experiment. In 2018 and 2019, we compiled existing data from the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency (NNEPA) and collected samples from surface and groundwater. We then used sunflower seedlings grown in local soil to assess whether phytoremediation could be effective at removing arsenic and uranium. For the NNEPA-sampled wells, 9.5% exceeded the maximum contaminant level for uranium (30 μg per liter) and 16% for arsenic (10 μg per liter). For the new samples, uranium was highest in surface pools, suggesting leaching from local soil. Unlike studies from humid regions, sunflowers did not decrease uranium and arsenic in soil water. Instead, there was no change in arsenic concentration and an increase in uranium concentration in both planted and control treatments, attributable to weathering of uranium-bearing minerals in the desert soil. Because much of global uranium mining occurs in arid and semiarid regions, the ineffectiveness of phytoremediation on the Navajo Nation emphasizes the importance of prevention and conventional remediation. More generally, the participatory science approach created meaningful relationships and an important collaboration between a tribal chapter and a university, providing both cultural and scientific experiential learning opportunities for Diné high school students, undergraduate researchers, and senior personnel. © 2018},

In particular, reports suggest that severe health risks are associated with exposure to elevated concentrations of radioactive materials such as potassium 40K, uranium 238U and 235U, and thorium 232Th. Few reviews address the occurrence, risk assessment, and potential remediation strategies of radioactive pollution in Nigerian environments. In waters, concentration as high as 2.42 ± 0.28 Bq/L has been reported in rivers, which is much higher than the radionuclide permissible level of 1 Bq/L. In soils, activity concentrations of gamma-emitting radioactive materials are higher than the worldwide average crustal values. In air, the absorbed dose rates are also often higher, of 86.44 nGy hr−1, than acceptable limits of 60 nGy hr−1. The level of radionuclides is indicative of the type and mineral composition of the parent rocks. Advances in remediation technologies suggest that electroremediation, bioremediation, and adsorption are the most efficient approaches for decontamination. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {In order to achieve the goal of circular economy and sustainable development of ecological environment, it is important to separate and recover associated elements from rare mineral resources. Compared with traditional physical and chemical remediation methods of contaminated soil, phytoremediation is regarded as the most promising green in-situ restoration technology. The purpose of this review is to effectively alleviate the environmental problems caused by rare tailings contaminated soil through phytoremediation and realize the recovery of uranium-thorium, rare earth elements (REEs) and tantalum-niobium. This review took rare tailings with uranium-thorium, REEs, tantalum-niobium in China as the research object, then the background, significance, mechanisms and application strategies of phytoremediation were elaborated. In addition, the cases of species with tolerance to uranium-thorium, tantalum-niobium as well as REEs and their remediation mechanisms were summarized, respectively. Particularly, the typical plants represented by Brassica juncea, Sunflower, Phytolacca americana, Dicranopteris dichotoma, Salix spp., etc., were very effective in the remediation of rare tailings. The influence factors of phytoremediation efficiency of tailings contaminated soil were discussed. Two main factors were the mobility of heavy metals in soil (external cause) and the enrichment ability of species (internal cause). Since the traditional phytoremediation also had some limitations, in view of this, the work discussed some auxiliary methods (such as chelating agents or microbial assisted restoration) to improve the efficiency of phytoremediation. Finally, the future development of phytoremediation and potential application directions were explored. © 2022, Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Providing safe drinking water to the world second largest population is key challenge for policymakers, especially when most of the soil-water system getting polluted. A growing extent and elevated concentration of selenium and uranium have been reported in the soil-water system of India’s North-West region. Weathering of Se containing geological formations nearby hills of the Sivalik range and their transportation by floodwater is a primary driving factor of elevated Se concentration in this region. The use of Se-contaminated water in irrigation further enriches its concentration in the groundwater system. The oxidative state of the shallow subsurface environment supports its leaching to underlying groundwater resources. Similarly, irrigation water may dissolve CO2 from plant respiration and microbial oxidation from the root zone (as the area is agriculture-dominated) and forms carbonic acid. Such carbonic acid dissolves the calcium carbonate (calcareous soil) to produce bicarbonate that leaches uranium from soils to the groundwater system. This manuscript has discussed detailed literature to present the environmental fate, distribution, expected future scenarios, and remedial measures of selenium and uranium in the Indian soil-water system. The manuscript will help understand the current status of both pollutants and applying remediation measures in field conditions. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Heavy metals (HMs) and radionuclides are released through geological and anthropogenic activities and enter the environment through wastewater, soil and sediment. Large amounts of Pb (>1000 ppm), Zn (>4000 ppm) and Cd (40–400 ppm) have recently been reported in soils near Picher, USA. These inorganic pollutants cannot be degraded and cause damage to the vital human organs. Different industrial and municipal solid waste was a major source of HMs in soil, including airborne aerosols. In the same manner, nuclear waste and radioactive materials used (e.g., medical facilities) or released in different processes contribute to the environmental pollution of radionuclides. The release of such HMs ions from different sources leads to mutagenesis, carcinogenesis and poses serious risks to the living organisms. As a result, proper management of waste from these sources, as well as environmentally friendly remediation methods, is imperative. However, recent studies have shown that it is more difficult to remove HMs and radionuclides from the soil, but they can be effectively neutralized or converted into a less toxic metabolites. The combination of a unique plant-microbe system plays a key role in the remediation process. However, new bioremediation methods are now being used to eliminate HMs and radionuclides. Microbes are capable of bio-transforming, bio-sorbing and biomineralizing HMs and radionuclides through their inherent catabolic process. Enhancing phytoremediation using different strategies for the remediation of HMs and radionuclides is necessary to ensure that the land resource is safe, fertile and productive for sustainable use. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Metal mining deeply modifies local environmental dynamics and produces large volumes of waste rock and residues, which is expected to be carefully disposed in order to prevent soil, water, and environment degradation. The Osamu Utsumi mine was a pioneer uranium ore exploitation site in Brazil, located in the State of Minas Gerais. The open pit and the high concentration of sulfide in waste rock piles are nowadays a dispendious concern to the Nuclear Industries of Brazil (INB, in Portuguese), due to sulfide oxidation and the resultant acid mine drainage (AMD). The objective of this research is to analyze the correlation between gamma-ray spectrometry data and the generation of AMD in a waste rock pile, locally known as BF-04. Potassium concentrations can be used to distinguish zones of rock depletion, lowest concentrations, and radioelement sedimentation. The radiometric data acquisition combined with previous studies indicates that high uranium and thorium concentrations are associated with high sulfide zones. The mineralized uranium ore includes sulfides that are rapidly destroyed by surface hydration conditions, responsible for generating acid mine drainage. In this sense, superficial zones in the waste rock pile with high levels of eU and eTh are areas exposed to oxidation and hydration of sulfides, and, therefore, their recognition and neutralization can contribute to decrease AMD generation in the study site and areas with similar characteristics. The gamma-ray spectrometry results can subsidize more effective and low-cost remediation techniques. © 2022. Geofisica Internacional. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {This research explored the effect of biochar pyrolyzed from five different materials on U and Cd immobilization in soil. The results showed that all biochars improved the soil properties and microbial metabolic activities, and effectively immobilized U and Cd, especially corn stalk biochar. Subsequently, three strains Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and Citrobacter sp. were mixed in a 3:3:2 proportion as a kind of mixed bacteria (MB9) that could adsorb U and Cd effectively. Two types of MB9-loaded biochar were synthesized by physical adsorption and sodium alginate embed method and referred to as AIB and EIB, respectively. MB9-loaded biochar showed superior U and Cd immobilization performance. At 75 d, the highest reduction in the DTPA- extractable U and Cd (69 % and 56 %) was achieved with the 3% AIB amendment. Additionally, compared to the addition of biochar or MB9 alone, AIB was more effective in promoting celery growth and reducing U and Cd accumulation. Finally, the microbial community structure analysis suggested that the relative abundance of Citrobacter genus and Bacillus genus was significantly increased, suggesting that the mixed bacteria MB9 was successfully colonized. These findings may provide a feasible technology for green and cost-effective remediation of heavy metal contamination in farmland soil. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

In the present study, a pot experiment was conducted to explore the effects of earthworms on the uranium phytoremediation process. Effects of cattle manure and Eisenia fetida on biomass and U accumulation of plants, U solubility, and pH in soil were investigated using DU-contaminated soil from Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona, U.S. Results showed that the growth of plants was promoted with the addition of cattle manure and earthworms, which was more obvious for sunflowers. Moreover, the U accumulation was significantly enhanced by earthworms and cattle manure, with a 68.5% (Indian mustard) and 85.0% (sunflower) increase in the cattle manure plus earthworm treatments, and the removal efficiencies of U were correspondingly improved. No significant effect on soil pH was observed, while the soil water extractable U was increased by 84.9-87.8% in the earthworm treatments. Moreover, after the 4-week cultivation, cattle manure benefited the survival of earthworms and slightly increased their average fresh weight in DU-contaminated soil. Therefore, this study concludes that earthworms combined with agricultural organic wastes was an alternative approach to effectively remediate DU-contaminated soils in firing ranges. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

	abstract = {The controllability of composition and structure of layered double hydroxide (LDH) is one of the important grounds for their widespread use in removing hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) from the environment. In this study, single-layer LDHs were successfully produced through an ultrasound-assisted process in the presence of formamide and characterized by X-Ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), atomic force microscope (AFM) and surface energy. Then LDHs were utilized to remove Cr(VI) in solutions, of which the results demonstrated that delaminated MgAl in formamide with ultrasound (F-U-MgAl) had the highest adsorption efficiency, and the adsorption equilibrium was reached in the first 1 min, with a removal rate of 100%. While the removal rate of Cr(VI) by delaminated MgAl without ultrasound (F-MgAl) and MgAl were only 77% and 12% after 60 min. Based on the XRD patterns and SEM images of samples before and after adsorption, the adsorption mechanisms of F-U-MgAl included anion exchange, surface adsorption and electrostatic attraction. The effects of initial pH, dosage, initial concentration, coexisting anions, and HA were also investigated. In addition, the adsorption in Cr(VI)-containing soil by LDHs was considered, and the results indicated that the single-layer LDHs had a broad application prospect in soil remediation. Besides that, we had also verified the above conclusion through the phytotoxicology tests. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The soil ecological health risks and toxic effects of coal gangue accumulation were examined after 10 years of elm/poplar phytoremediation. The changes in soil enzyme activities, ionome metabolism, and microbial community structure were analyzed at shallow (5–15 cm), intermediate (25–35 cm), and deep (45–55 cm) soil depths. Soil acid phosphatase activity in the restoration area increased significantly by 4.36–7.18 fold (p < 0.05). Soil concentrations of the metal ions Cu, Pb, Ni, Co, Bi, U, and Th were significantly reduced, as were concentrations of the non-metallic element S. The repair effect was shallow > middle > deep. The soil community structure, determined by 16S diversity results, was changed significantly in the restoration area, and the abundance of microorganisms increased at shallow soil depths. Altererythrobacter and Sphingomonas species were at the center of the microbial weight network in the restoration area. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that S and Na are important driving forces for the microbial community distributions at shallow soil depths. The KEGG function prediction indicated enhancement of the microbial function of the middle depth soil layers in the restoration area. Overall, phytoremediation enhanced the biotransformation of soil phosphorus in the coal gangue restoration area, reduced the soil content of several harmful metal elements, significantly changed the structure and function of the microbial community, and improved the overall soil ecological environment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The inexorable flow of heavy metals such as (Pb), mercury (Hg), chromium (Cr), zinc (Zn), uranium (Ur), selenium (Se), silver (Ag), gold (Au), cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), and arsenic created unhinge in the ecosystem and become recalcitrant pollutants. Due to anthropogenic interference in the natural system, heavy metals are incorporated in the food chain of the organism, which leads to deleterious effects in the growth of plants and animals. Anthropogenic sources such as industry effluent, agricultural land, and wastewater sludge are continuous sources of heavy metal induction in soil water and the environment. Looking toward hazardous ongoing deleterious effects of heavy metals, there is a need of an efficient, eco-friendly, and cost-effective approach to safeguard the entire ecosystem. Heavy metal is not destroyed by microbes but can be transformed into an innocuous state. Ecosystem possesses a plethora of diverse microorganism which exists, survives, and completes its lifecycle in the extreme environment. Microbes such as fungus can change the structure of the contaminant to make it harmless to humans and animals or change the solubility of the contaminant so that it can no longer mix into and mobilize. Among them, fungi inherit robust features and distinguished mechanisms to tolerate heavy metal stress. Fungi possess complex oxidative and hydrolytic enzymatic (such as cytochrome P450 monooxygenases and glutathione transferases) systems for detoxifying toxic compounds in the environment. Therefore, fungi can effectively sequester the contaminant, thus limiting recalcitrant pollutants to the living organism. In this chapter, we have discussed the role of heavy metals on the environment and mechanism used by fungi to remedying the environment. This study highlighted multiple modes employed by fungi to detoxify heavy metals from the environment. Herein heavy metals taken via different forms of fungi were also discussed such as endophytic fungi and quantum dots. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic activities involving uranium mining, nuclear fuel processing, nuclear weapon production, or nuclear power plant accidents have polluted soil and groundwater. As a byproduct of the uranium enrichment process for nuclear energy production, depleted uranium metal is available for use in a number of non-energy applications. Many of these uses cause a distribution of uranium metal, soluble uranium species, and oxides in the environment. A number of restoration techniques have been developed. One remedial approach is in situ biomineralization of U to form highly stable and insoluble U mineral products in soils and sediments. This review covers the current research status of uranium biomineralization using phosphate. The biogeochemical processes, biomineralization mechanisms, and biogeochemical conditions associated with the formation of uranium phosphate minerals were reviewed. This overview may be used to facilitate the further development and optimization of in situ bioremediation strategies for uranium in environmental systems.  © 2020 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The important role of microbes in the biomineralization and migration behavior of uranium in the field of environmental chemistry has been well emphasized in previous work. However, limited work on mineralization processes of indigenous microorganism has prevented us from a deeper understanding of the process and mechanisms of uranium biomineralization. In this work, the dynamic process and mechanism of uranium biomineralization in Enterobacter sp. X57, a novel uranium-tolerant microorganism separated from uranium contaminated soil, were systematically investigated. Enterobacter sp. X57 can induce intracellular mineralization of U (VI) to Uramphite (NH4UO2PO4·3H2O) under neutral conditions by alkaline phosphatase. In this biomineralization process, soluble U (VI) first bonded with the amino and phosphate groups on the plasma membrane, providing initial nucleation site for the formation of U (VI) biominerals. Then the impairment of cell barrier function and the enhancement of alkaline phosphatase metabolism occurred with the accumulation of uranium in cells, creating a possible pathway for soluble U (VI) to diffuse into the cell and be further mineralized into U (VI)-phosphate minerals. All the results revealed that the intracellular biomineralization of uranium by Enterobacter sp. X57 was a combined result of biosorption, intracellular accumulation and phosphatase metabolism. These findings may contribute to a better understanding of uranium biomineralization behavior and mechanism of microorganisms, as well as possible in-situ bioremediation strategies for uranium by indigenous microorganisms. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Environmental pollution by heavy metals (HMs) has raised considerable attention due to their toxic impacts on plants, animals and human beings. Thus, the environmental cleanup of these toxic (HMs) is extremely urgent both from the environmental and biological point of view. To remediate HMs-polluted environment, several nanoparticles (NPs) such as metals and its oxides, carbon materials, zeolites, and bimetallic NPs have been documented. Among these, Fe-based NPs have emerged as an effective choice for remediating environmental contamination, due to infinite size, high reactivity, and adsorption properties. This review summarizes the utilization of various Fe-based NPs such as nano zero-valent iron (NZVI), modified-NZVI, supported-NZVI, doped-NZVI, and Fe oxides and hydroxides in remediating the HMs-polluted environment. It presents a comprehensive elaboration on the possible reaction mechanisms between the Fe-based NPs and heavy metals, including adsorption, oxidation/reduction, and precipitation. Subsequently, the environmental factors (e.g., pH, organic matter, and redox) affecting the reactivity of the Fe-based NPs with heavy metals are also highlighted in the current study. Research shows that Fe-based NPs can be toxic to living organisms. In this context, this review points out the environmental hazards associated with the application of Fe-based NPs and proposes future recommendations for the utilization of these NPs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The objective of this work was to explore centrifugal ultrafiltration (UF) to separate and / or preconcentrate natural colloidal particles for their characterization. A soil suspension obtained by batch leaching was used as a laboratory reference sample. It was preconcentrated with concentration factors (CF) varying from 10 to 450. The dimensional analysis of the colloidal phase was carried out by Asymmetric Flow Field-Flow Fractionation (AF4)-multidetection. The colloidal masses were estimated by mass balance of the initial suspension, its concentrates and filtrates. The size-dependent distribution (expressed in gyration radius) and total colloidal mass (especially recovery), as well as chemical composition and concentration (including species partitioning between dissolved and colloidal phases) were determined to assess the effects of UF preconcentration on colloidal particles. The gyration radius of the colloidal particles recovered in these concentrated suspensions ranged from about 20 nm to over 150 nm. Neither de-agglomeration nor agglomeration was observed. However, only (64 ± 4) % (CF = 10) of the colloidal particles initially in the soil suspension were found in the recovered concentrated suspensions, and this percentage decreased as CF increased. The filter membrane trapped all other particles, mainly the larger ones. Whatever the CF, the centrifugal UF did not appear to change the dissolved-colloidal partitioning of certain species (Al, organic carbon); whereas it led to an enrichment of the colloidal phase for others (Fe, U). The enrichment rate was specific to each species (15% for Fe; 100% for U). By fitting the observed trends (i.e. conservation, depletion or enrichment of the colloidal phase in the concentrate) as a function of CF, the colloidal concentrations (total and species) were assessed without bias. This methodology offers a new perspective for determining physicochemical speciation in natural waters, with a methodology applicable for environmental survey or site remediation studies. © 2021},

	abstract = {The behaviors of U(VI) in environmental media around radioactive waste disposal site are important for safety assessment of geological repositories. However, the estimation of environmental behaviors of U(VI) in natural media was insufficient. This work aimed to determine the adsorption of U(VI) on natural soil surrounding a candidate very low-level radioactive waste (VLLW) disposal site in southwest China. Results showed that the adsorption process of U(VI) on soils could be well supported by pseudo-second-order kinetic and Freundlich model. The adsorption of U(VI) was pH-dependent but temperature-independent. High ionic strength (NaCl) strongly affected the adsorption process at low pH (2.0–5.5). CO32− remarkably inhibited the U(VI) adsorption, while the adsorption of U(VI) was promoted by PO43− and SO42−. Naturally occurred soil organic matters (SOMs) showed high affinity for U(VI), while the presence of additional humic acid (HA) strongly inhibited U(VI) adsorption. The occurrence of ferrous iron could result in the reduction of U(VI) at low pH values (pH < 4), leading to the promotion of immobilization of U(VI). These findings would provide some guidance for the safety assessments of the VLLW disposal as well as the remediation of contaminated soil. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Soil samples collected from the beds (N = 22) and surrounding grounds (N = 24) of existing community garden sites in Houston, TX, were screened for trace and heavy metals using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. The survey indicated that community gardeners had few concerns with regard to potential soilborne hazards and were generally willing to use diverse strategies to reduce potential hazards related to garden soil contamination. Ground and garden bed soil collected from community gardens were found to have excess concentrations of arsenic compared to federal health screening limits.

	abstract = {Soil, water and sediments contamination caused by uranium (U)-as a result of anthropogenic activities-remains a major concern worldwide. In effect, the large quantity of radioactive waste is increasing the environmental impact of U on living organisms due to its potential for long term contamination. As it is necessary to reduce the environmental impact, many methodologies have been employed, including bioremediation. This biotechnological approach takes advantage of the ability of organisms such as bacteria, fungi or algae to trap and immobilise U; although bioremediation does not reduce the widespread U contamination, its specific value is to concentrate up U in the aforementioned organisms. Currently, there are many data in the literature coming from many biotechnological studies dealing with U trappers, nevertheless, it is not known which is the best U trapper. Therefore, aiming to solve this open question, Partial Order Theory was applied. 83 prokaryotes were ranked applying local partial models (LPOM). The two ranking methods show the same first optimal microorganisms, starting with the best one: Bacillus licheniformis ATCC 14580, Bacillus mucilaginosus ACCC 10012, Pseudomonas MGF-48(50), Bacillus subtilis IAM 11062, Streptomyces sp., Pseudomonas sp. EPS-5028, Actinomyces levoris HUT 6156 and Arthrobacter nicotianae IAM 12342. These results highlight the usefulness of microorganisms for developing bioremediation procedures of aqueous systems polluted with U. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

Compared with the A-2+P+U and P+U groups, the bioavailable uranium in soil in AC+A-2+P+U group was increased by 12.5% and 28.57%, respectively. In the AC+A-2+P+U groups, there were a large number of Fusarium fungi and Acidobacteria in rhizosphere soil, and the proportion of Fusarium fungi was the highest. Compared with AC+P+U, A-2+P+U, P+U, and A-2+U groups, the proportion of Fusarium fungi in AC+A-2+P+U group was increased by 16.67%, 81.03%, 299.23% and 374.47%, respectively. The mechanisms of AC and A-2 coupling enhanced the remediation of uranium contaminated soil by Macleaya cordata may be include that AC improved the mobility of uranium in soil, increased the contact between plant roots and uranium, and promoted the enrichment of uranium by Macleaya cordata; that AC stimulated the physiological activity and increased the biomass of Macleaya cordata, improved the activity of antioxidant enzymes, and enhanced the tolerance of Macleaya cordata to uranium; and that AC stimulated the growth of A-2 fungi and Acidobacteria, increased their proportion, and produced a large number of organic acids which can form chelates with uranium, reduced the stress of uranium on plants, increased the proportion of bioavailable speciation of uranium, and promoted the enrichment of uranium by Macleaya cordata. AC and A-2 coupling exhibited a significant enhancement effect on the remediation of uranium contaminated soil by Macleaya cordata, and there coupling was a promising enhancement method. © 2022, Editorial Board of China Environmental Science.

Radionuclides of the uranium decay chains, such as U238, U234, U235, Th230, Ra226 etc., in soil in in-situ uranium leaching areas impose risk and hazard on mine personnel and on nature. The content of radionuclides in contaminated soil is determined in order to prevent the adverse effect of their radiation. With the known content and specific activity of radionuclides in soil, the soil remediation methods are identified, including machinery, technology and leaching techniques. This article presents the sequence of remediation and the operating principle of the new flowchart. The portability and low costs of the flowchart are demonstrated. In contaminated soil under analysis, the content of general uranium ranges from 0.00293 to 0.00513%. After treatment of contaminated soil using the proposed method, the content of uranium decreases and becomes 0.00145 to 0.00255%. The proposed method of remediation of soil contaminated with the uranium decoy chain radionuclides is assumed to be suitable for the application on a large scale. © 2021 Publishing house Mining book.

	abstract = {The formation of uranyl phosphate precipitates is a remediation strategy to limit the mobility of uranium in contaminated soils. However, exposure to organic ligands, like the plant exudate citrate, can remobilize the uranium. The purpose of this study is to provide a more thorough comprehension of citrate-promoted dissolution of a uranyl phosphate mineral, chernikovite [(H3O)(UO2)(PO4)·3H2O], by determining the extent of uranium release from chernikovite at a wide range of citrate concentrations. We have quantified the kinetics of dissolution and proposed potential mechanisms of chernikovite dissolution to gain a better understanding of the fate of uranyl phosphate precipitates in the environment. Batch dissolution and continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) experiments indicate that increasing citrate concentrations from 0.1 mM to 50 mM increases the concentration of dissolved uranium. However, at citrate concentrations of 10 mM and greater, the effectiveness of the ligand to enhance the dissolution decreases. Density functional theory modeling and Raman spectroscopy indicate a strong interaction between citrate and the uranyl ions at the surface of the uranyl phosphate. The interaction between citrate and uranyl suggests the formation of an alteration layer of uranyl-citrate surface complexes, which could impede uranium release at citrate concentrations of 10 mM or higher. Together, these results indicate that the citrate-promoted dissolution of chernikovite is a fast reaction that is hindered by a combination of surface saturation and a secondary-phase precipitation reaction at higher concentrations of citrate and reaction times greater than or equal to 72 min based on the hydraulic residence time of CSTR experiments. These findings improve our understanding of the stability of uranyl phosphate for use in sequestration of uranium groundwater plumes at contaminated sites. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Humic acids (HAs) are complex organic substances with abundant functional groups (e.g., carboxyl, phenolic-OH, etc.). They are commonly distributed in the soil environment and exert a double-edged sword effect in controlling the migration and transformation of uranium. However, the effects of HAs on dynamic processes associated with uranium transformation are still unclear. In this study, we used HAs derived from leonardite (L-HA) and commercial HA (C-HA) as exogenous organic matter and C-HA as the reference. UO2, UO3, and UO2(NO3)2 were used as the sources of U to explore the fractionations of uranium in the soil. We also studied the behavior of the HA. The incubation experiments were designed to investigate the effects of HA on the soil pH, uranium fraction transformation, dynamic behavior of exchangeable, weak acid, and labile uranium. The observations were made for one month. The results showed that soil pH decreased for L-HA but increased for C-HA. Under these conditions, uranium tended to transform into an inactive fraction. The dynamic behavior of exchangeable, weak acid, and labile uranium varied with the sources of HA and uranium. This study highlighted that HA could affect soil pH and the dynamic redistribution of U fractions. The results suggest that the sources of HA and U should be considered when using HA as the remediation material for uranium-contaminated soils. © Copyright 2022 Meng et al.},

	abstract = {Radioactive acidic liquid waste is a common byproduct of uranium (U) and plutonium (Pu) enrichment and recycling processes whose accidental and planned release has led to a significant input of U into soils and sediments across the world, including at the U.S. DOE's Hanford site (WA, USA). Because of the particularly hazardous nature of U, it is important to predict its speciation when introduced into soils and sediments by acidic waste fluids. Of fundamental importance are the coupled effects of acid-driven mineral transformation and reactive transport on U speciation. To evaluate the effect of waste-fluid residence time and co-associated dissolved phosphate concentrations on U speciation in impacted soils and sediments, uncontaminated surface materials (from the Hanford Site) were reacted with U-containing synthetic acidic waste fluids (pH 2) amended with dissolved phosphate concentrations in both batch (no flow) and flow-through column systems for 7–365 days. By comparing dissolved U behavior and solid phase speciation as a function of flow regimen, we found that the availability of proton-promoted dissolution products (such as Si) to sequester U into uranyl silicates was dependent on waste fluid-sediment contact time as uranyl silicates were not detected in short contact time flow-through systems but were detected in no-flow, long contact time, reactors. Moreover, the dominance of uranyl phosphate as neoprecipitate U scavenger (principally in the form of meta-ankoleite) in phosphate amended systems confirmed the importance of phosphate amendments for an efficient sequestration of U in the soils and sediments. Overall, our experiments suggest that the formation of uranyl silicates in soils impacted by acidic waste fluids is likely to be limited unless reaction products are allowed to accumulate in soil pores, highlighting the importance of investigating soil U speciation in flow-through, transport-driven systems as opposed to no-flow, batch systems. This study provides insights into uranium speciation and its potential changes under acidic conditions for better prediction of risks and subsequent development of efficient remediation strategies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

This study reviews the mechanisms of biomineralization of urease-producing microorganisms and their biogeochemical process with various heavy metals and trace elements. Biogeochemical factors affecting the formation of carbonate biominerals were discussed. These factors included the growth and urease activity of microorganisms, calcium concentration and coexisted cations/anions, dissolved inorganic carbon, pH, redox potential, etc. In addition, the mechanisms of the biomineral morphology and its controlling factors such as medium types, microbial species, and extracellular polymeric substance were analyzed as well.

	abstract = {The global environmental changes have been observed since the nineties of the twentieth century. The current environmental situation is caused mainly due to the intensive human activity. During 46 years, from 1945 to 1991, radioactive waste from uranium processing was accumulated in the Sughd region in Tajikistan, the former USSR Republic. According to various estimates the total amount of accumulated radioactivity varies from 240 to 285 TBq. The tailings are the major sources of environmental pollution, they contain emanating gas, aerosols, dust and filterable solutions. The purpose of the work is to conduct comparison assessment of the potential radiation hazard of “Digmai” and “Adrasman” tailing dumps and Istiklol-city in the Sughd region and to estimate radiological risks to the population living near the tailing dumps. For radon monitoring both integral and instantaneous measurements were used. For instant measurements of radon volumetric activity the PPA-01M-03 LLC “HTM-Protection” (Russia) raidometer was used. The background radiation in the area under study was measured with Dosimeters DKS-96 “Dose” (Russia), DKS-AT1123 “Atomtech” (Belarus), MKS-AT6130 “Atomtech” (Belarus) and PackEye FHT complex-1377 “Thermo” (Germany). The paper presents data on comparison assessment of potential hazard of radioactive tailing dumps in the Sughd area. The impact of uranium tailing dumps on radioecological situation in the Sughd region, as well as in cities and districts of the Sughd region was assessed. The most unfavorable radioecological situation in the Sughd region is in areas with the ambient dose equivalent power (MAED)>0.35-0.40 μSv/h. The coordinates of the areas location coincide with coordinates of the radioactive tailing dumps Istiklol-city and Gaziyeon (“Digmai”) location, and their adjacent territories. According to comparison assessment, the tailing dumps “Digmai” and “Factory of Poor Ores” (Istiklol-city) are potentially the most hazardous facilities. It means that for radioecological safety of the environment and the population, it is recommended to carry out cleaning and remediation of the tailing dumps as a priority: «Digmai» and «Factory of poor ores». © 2022 National Medical Research Radiological Centre of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation.

	abstract = {Calcium carbonates (CaCO3) are ubiquitous naturally occurring minerals in soils and subsurface sediments. Calcium carbonate coatings are common in many terrestrial environments and are known to coat a variety of reactive mineral surfaces in soils and sediments, altering their reactivity and chemical behavior. For these reasons, contaminant interactions with CaCO3 minerals are relevant and important to evaluation of the overall contaminant fate and transport in different surface and subsurface environments. Significant advancements have been made recently toward identifying relevant contaminant (e.g., uranium (U), iodine (I), and chromium (Cr), but also others, such as arsenic (As)) attenuation mechanisms, which may also serve as a basis for developing in situ remediation strategies. Hence, the objective of this review paper is to (1) describe the state-of-knowledge of calcium carbonate minerals as universal scavengers of metals (Cr and As) and radionuclides (U and I); (2) provide a state of the science of how calcium carbonate interactions affect contaminant fate and transport in the subsurface environmental systems; and (3) provide insights on the use of calcium carbonate natural attenuation mechanisms and their application to the remediation of complex sites. Knowledge gaps are also identified that, when closed, can advance the use of carbonate minerals for in situ remedy applications. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Herein, a novel nanosphere composed of a magnetic h-Fe3O4 (hollow ferroferric oxide) core and a phos-LDH (phosphate-modified layered double hydroxide) shell was synthesized. The h-Fe3O4@phos-LDH nanocomposite with rich phosphate groups and large specific surface area (93.53 m2/g) can be exploited for uranium (VI) elimination. Batch experiments were conducted to investigate the impacts of various conditions (pH, time, and temperatures) on U(VI) removal process. The maximum capacity of U(VI) adsorbed by h-Fe3O4@phos-LDH reached up to 542.6 mg/g at 298.15 K, and the adsorption isotherms were followed the Langmuir model. Thermodynamics analyses illustrated that the U(VI) adsorbed by h-Fe3O4@phos-LDH was a spontaneous and endothermic process. The characterization analysis manifested that the phosphate groups of the phos-LDH shell played a leading role in adsorption. More importantly, the removal of U(VI) from the soil by h-Fe3O4@phos-LDH with the assistance of an electromagnetic separation system was also investigated. The results indicated that h-Fe3O4@phos-LDH could remove more than 90% of U(VI) in soil. These findings demonstrated this work could be considered as a valuable research for the environment remediation. © 2022},

	abstract = {Uranium(U), a highly toxic radionuclide, is becoming a great threat to soil health development, as returning nuclear waste containing U into the soil systems is increased. Numerous studies have focused on: i) tracing the source in U contaminated soils; ii) exploring U geochemistry; and iii) assessing U phyto-uptake and its toxicity to plants. Yet, there are few literature reviews that systematically summarized the U in soil-plant system in past decade. Thus, we present its source, geochemical behavior, uptake, toxicity, detoxification, and bioremediation strategies based on available data, especially published from 2018 to 2021. In this review, we examine processes that can lead to the soil U contamination, indicating that mining activities are currently the main sources. We discuss the relationship between U bioavailability in the soil-plant system and soil conditions including redox potential, soil pH, organic matter, and microorganisms. We then review the soil-plant transfer of U, finding that U mainly accumulates in roots with a quite limited translocation. However, plants such as willow, water lily, and sesban are reported to translocate high U levels from roots to aerial parts. Indeed, U does not possess any identified biological role, but provokes numerous deleterious effects such as reducing seed germination, inhibiting plant growth, depressing photosynthesis, interfering with nutrient uptake, as well as oxidative damage and genotoxicity. Yet, plants tolerate U toxicity via various defense strategies including antioxidant enzymes, compartmentalization, and phytochelatin. Moreover, we review two biological remediation strategies for U-contaminated soil: (i) phytoremediation and (ii) microbial remediation. They are quite low-cost and eco-friendly compared with traditional physical or chemical remediation technologies. Finally, we conclude some promising research challenges regarding U biogeochemical behavior in soil-plant systems. This review, thus, further indicates that the combined application of U low accumulators and microbial inoculants may be an effective strategy for the bioremediation of U-contaminated soils. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Willows, woody plants of genus Salix common in floodplains of temperate regions, act as plant pumps and translocate the Cd and Zn in the soil profiles of uncontaminated and weakly contaminated floodplains from the sediment bulk to the top strata. We suggest this process occurs because the Cd and Zn concentrations in willow leaves exceed those in the sediments. Senescing foliage of plant species common in floodplains can increase the Cd and Zn ratios as compared to other elements (Pb and common ‘lithogenic elements’ such as Al) in the top strata of all floodplains, including those that have been severely contaminated. The top enrichment is caused by the root uptake of specific elements by growing plants, which is followed by foliage deposition. Neither the shallow groundwater nor the plant foliage shows that Cd, Zn, and Pb concentrations are related to those in the sediments, but they clearly reflect the shallow groundwater pH, with the risk element mobilised by the acidity that is typical for the subsurface sediments in floodplains. The effect that plants have on the Pb in floodplains is significantly lower than that observed for Cd and Zn, while U can be considered even less mobile than Pb. Groundwater and plant leaves can contribute to secondary contamination with Cd and Zn from floodplain pollution hotspots, meaning that plants can accumulate these elements on the floodplain surface or even return them back to the fluvial transport, even if bank erosion would not occur. For Pb and U at the sites studied, these risks were negligible. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Attention is increasingly being paid to the contamination of soil by the radioactive element uranium (U). Phytoremediation of contaminated soil by economically advantageous and environment-protective plants shows considerable potential for addressing this problem. Populus cathayana is a species with high heavy-metal tolerance, economic value, and notable potential for phytoremediation. Plant-sex-related differences can lead to differences in vegetative growth and tolerance to various stressors. As such, in this study, we designed a pot experiment to analyze the responses of male and female trees of P. cathayana to 50 mg kg−1 U stress in contaminated soil for 3 months. We studied the U uptake and distribution, photosynthesis, chlorophyll fluorescence, active oxygen species, and antioxidant enzymes of P. cathayana. The results showed that the photosynthetic activity and chlorophyll fluorescence of male and female trees were similar, and U stress mainly affected the nonstomatal factors and photosystem II during photosynthesis. Regarding the physiological and biochemical processes, male and female trees showed different defense strategies: male trees had higher peroxidase (POD), H2O2, and soluble sugars, but lower malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and soluble proteins. Under U stress, the active oxygen produced by male trees could be cleared by antioxidant enzymes, preventing damage to the cell membrane. Male trees accumulated a higher U concentration in their roots than female trees, whereas the transportation of U from roots to leaves in male trees was lower than that in female trees. Therefore, our results suggested that male trees have a higher tolerance capacity and greater ability to remediate U-polluted soil than female trees. Future phytoremediation studies should consider the differences between plant sexes in the tolerance to U-contaminated land. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Uranium (U) in the U-contaminated acidic red soil exhibits high mobility. In the present study, rice husk was used to produce biochar to remediate U-contaminated red soil under acid precipitation. Firstly, batch adsorption experiments showed that the dissolution of alkaline substance in biochar could buffer the pH value of acidic solution. The equilibrium pH value had a crucial influence on biochar adsorption capacity of U, and the neutral equilibrium pH value was favorable for adsorption. Then, the incubation experiments of red soil with biochar were performed, and the Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure (SPLP) extraction of amended red soil showed that the short-term leachability of U was decreased from 26.53% in control group (without biochar) to 1.40% in 10% biochar-amended red soil. Subsequently, the sequential extraction showed that the fraction of U was mainly transformed from exchangeable and Fe/Mn oxide fraction to carbonate fraction after biochar amendment, and the total amount of exchangeable U and carbonate fraction U in soil was increased slightly. Finally, simulated acid rain leaching experiments showed that the capability of amended red soil to resist acid rain acidification was enhanced. And the long-term leachability of U in amended red soil was decreased from 26.37% in control group to 3.18% in the 10% biochar-amended red soil under the simulated acid rain leaching conditions. In conclusion, biochar has passivation effect on U in U-contaminated red soil, which can reduce the long-term and short-term mobility of U in acidic environments. This study provided an experimental basis for the application of biochar in remediation and improvement of U-contaminated acidic red soil. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Uranium (U) contamination due to mining and metallurgical operations is a serious problem and poses a high potential threat to humans and other organisms. The application of amendments and/or plants, known as assisted phytoremediation, can accelerate the adsorption, complexation and precipitation processes in soil, and therefore can facilitate the restoration of U mining areas. This study located in the central-west of peninsular Spain was focussed on two different U mine waste dumps (MWD), where the assisted phytoremediation process was implemented. At each MWD, an area of 10 ha (approx.) was selected for sugar lime (SL) application, at a rate of 75 T ha −1. In addition, after SL addition, common grasses Cynodon dactylon, Secale cereale, and the leguminosae Vicia sativa were seeded. Evolution of soil physico-chemical properties and plant development was monitored for 69 months in Top, Medium and Low areas of both MWDs. The main results indicated a positive effect of the amendment, improving the development of the spontaneous and induced vegetation and the accumulation of soil organic matter. Values of pH were maintained in the range of the neutrality during all the experimentation period. In general, total concentrations of trace elements (including U) presented a high variability. Values were similar in the different studied areas of each MWD (Top, Medium and Low) and did not change in time. Trace elements contents were, in general, higher than those found in non-contaminated soils. However, U and Mn availability decreased with time, as well as the accumulation of trace elements (especially U and Mn) in the studied plants. Moreover, these contents were lower than the permitted limit for animal consumption. In conclusion, application of phytoremediation contributed to the stabilization of U within the soil-plant system, mainly by its positive effects on vegetation cover and the consequent increase in soil organic matter. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Uranium, a radionuclide, is a predominant element utilized for speciality requirements in industrial applications, as fuels and catalyst. The radioactive properties and chemical toxicity of uranium causes a major threat to the ecosystem. The hazards associated with Uranium pollution includes the cancer in bones, liver, and lungs. The toxicological properties of Uranium are discussed in detail. Although there are many methods to eliminate those hazards, this research work is aimed to describe the application of bioremediation methods. Bioremediation methods involve elimination of the hazards of uranium, by transforming into low oxidation form using natural microbes and plants. This study deeply elucidates the methods as bioleaching, biosorption, bioreduction and phytoremediation. Bioleaching process involves bio-oxidation of tetravalent uranium when it gets in contact with acidophilic metal bacterial complex to obtain leach liquor. In biosorption, chitin/chitosan derived sorbents act as chelators and binds with uranium by electrostatic attraction. Bio reduction employs a bacterial transformation into enzymes which immobilize and reduce uranium. Phytoremediation includes phytoextraction and phytotranslocation of uranium through xylems from soil to roots and shoots of plants. The highest uranium removal and uptake reported using the different methods are listed as follows: bioleaching (100% uranium recovery), biosorption (167 g kg−1 uranium uptake), bioreduction (98.9% uranium recovery), and phytoremediation (49,639 mg kg−1 uranium uptake). Among all the techniques mentioned above, bioleaching has been proved to be the most efficient for uranium remediation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Contrary to the optimistic expectations three decades ago, global military expenditure is increasing rather rapidly, fueled by the increasing intensity of international tensions. As a consequence of this, the military-caused soil pollution gains in importance. On the basis of a bibliometric analysis of 3500 articles, it is obvious that the level of interest in this topic has been rather fluctuating in the last decades, but in the last years, more than two hundred and fifty new publications have been appearing annually. The majority of publications are authored by US, Chinese, and Western European authors. Five main research areas could be identified by the cluster analysis of the following keywords: Heavy metal pollution, water resource pollution, consequences of soil pollution in the food chain, pollution by organic components and soil remediation, and analytic method development. The most central problem of research is heavy metal contamination. The basic topics of research are risk management, water contamination, and the depleted uranium problem. There is a further need to study the possibilities of decreasing of level of chemical pollutants, especially heavy metals. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {We developed a novel solidification and stabilization process using a nanoscale zerovalent iron (NZVI)-cement system for reductive immobilization of hexavalent uranium (U(VI)) in a soil–cement matrix. The NZVI suspension without cement demonstrated high removal efficiency (100% in 2 h) and fast removal kinetics (53.7 Lm−2d−1), which surpassed those of other Fe-containing minerals (i.e., green rust, mackinawite, magnetite, and pyrite). Significant removal of aqueous U(VI) was observed in NZVI-cement slurries and minimal adsorbed U was desorbed by a bicarbonate/carbonate (CARB) solution. Surface analysis using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed U distributed homogeneously on the surface of the NZVI-cement and transformed considerably from U(VI) to reduced U species by coupled oxidation of Fe(0)/Fe(II) to Fe(III). Furthermore, the increase in pH and NZVI concentration, and presence of humic acid resulted in the enhanced U(VI) reduction in NZVI-cement slurries. The NZVI-cement system was tested with a soil matrix, resulting in successful immobilization of aqueous U(VI) in both batch and column experiments. Moreover, the U(VI) removed in the NZVI-cement system was not leached out by the CARB solution during long-term experiments. The results suggest an NZVI-cement system could represent a promising remediation alternative for effective and stable immobilization of U(VI) in contaminated sites. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Plants could mobilize (dissolution followed by vertical transport) uranium (U) from mineral forms that are otherwise stable. However, the variability of this plant-mediated mobilization of U as a function of the presence of various essential plant nutrients contained in these minerals remains unknown. A series of column experiments were conducted using Andropogon virginicus to quantify the vertical transport of U from stable mineral forms as influenced by the chemical and physical coexistence of U with the essential nutrient, phosphorus (P). The presence of plants significantly increased the vertical migration of U only when U was precipitated with P (UO2HPO4·4H2O; chernikovite) but not from UO2 (uraninite) that lacks any essential plant nutrient. The U dissolution was further increased when chernikovite co-occurred with a sparingly available form of P (FePO4) under P-limited growing conditions. Similarly, A. virginicus accumulated the highest amount of U from chernikovite (0.05 mg/g) in the presence of FePO4 compared to that of uraninite (no-P) and chernikovite supplemented with KH2PO4. These results signify an increased plant-mediated dissolution, uptake, and leaching of radioactive contaminants in soils that are nutrient deficient, a key factor that should be considered in management at legacy contamination sites.  © 2020 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Despite the recent advancements in culturomics, isolation of the majority of environmental microbiota performing critical ecosystem services, such as bioremediation of contaminants, remains elusive. Towards this end, we conducted a metagenomics-guided comparative assessment of soil microbial diversity and functions present in uraniferous soils relative to those that grew in diffusion chambers (DC) or microbial traps (MT), followed by isolation of uranium (U) resistant microbiota. Shotgun metagenomic analysis performed on the soils used to establish the DC/MT chambers revealed Proteobacterial phyla and Burkholderia genus to be the most abundant among bacteria. The chamber-associated growth conditions further increased their abundances relative to the soils. Ascomycota was the most abundant fungal phylum in the chambers relative to the soils, with Penicillium as the most dominant genus. Metagenomics-based taxonomic findings completely mirrored the taxonomic composition of the retrieved isolates such that the Uresistant bacteria and fungi mainly belonged to Burkholderia and Penicillium species, thus confirming that the chambers facilitated proliferation and subsequent isolation of specific microbiota with environmentally relevant functions. Furthermore, shotgun metagenomic analysis also revealed that the gene classes for carbohydrate metabolism, virulence, and respiration predominated with functions related to stress response, membrane transport, and metabolism of aromatic compounds were also identified, albeit at lower levels. Of major note was the successful isolation of a potentially novel Penicillium species using the MT approach, as evidenced by whole genome sequence analysis and comparative genomic analysis, thus enhancing our overall understanding on the uranium cycling microbiota within the tested uraniferous soils. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Applying biodegradable chelating agents to assist in phytoremediation is a promising method to increase the remove efficiency of metal pollutants from contaminated soils. The effects of biodegradable chelating agents on improving the phytoremediation capacity in uranium (U) and cadmium (Cd) contaminated soil was investigated using sunflowers, which were grown in pots containing soil with U and Cd added at 15 mg/kg. After 2 months of growth, citric acid (CA), oxalic acid (OA) and ethylenediamine disuccinate (EDDS) at various concentrations (0, 2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 mmol/kg) were applied. The results showed that plant biomass decreased by 12.12% for shoot and 15.74% for root under U and Cd combined stress. Meanwhile, chelating agent treatments, especially with EDDS, enhanced U and Cd stress in plants by decreasing biomass, inhibiting photosynthesis, and increasing malondialdehyde and H2O2 levels. The U uptake of plants after CA addition was significantly greater than that after OA and EDDS addition. Nevertheless, EDDS addition has better effects on Cd uptake than CA and OA addition. U and Cd remove efficiencies reached the maximum following the application of 5.0 mmol/kg CA and 5.0 mmol/kg EDDS, which were 177.48% and 181.51% higher than that of the control, respectively. Furthermore, the bioavailable U content in soils treated with CA were higher than that in soils treated with EDDS, whereas bioavailable Cd content significantly increased due to EDDS addition. These results suggest that biodegradable chelating agents have significant effects on improving the U and Cd phytoremediation potential of sunflowers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Physical and chemical techniques are widely used in remediation, whereas generally expensive and challenging. Microbial mediated uranium bioreduction is an environmental-friendly technology, showing great potential in uranium remediation. Over the past twenty years, a diverse range of soil bacteria have been identified with the ability in reducing U(VI) to U(IV), including but not limited to Fe(III)- and sulphate-reducing bacteria. The recent progress in molecular mechanisms of bacterial U(VI) reduction was reviewed, especially the various pathways of extracellular electron transfer, including the metal-reducing pathway of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, the porin-cytochrome-mediated pathway and nanowire pathway of Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA. Competitive electron acceptors and coexisting ions played important roles in bacterial U(VI) reduction. The molecular mechanisms by which bacteria transfer electrons across the outer membrane and then exchange electrons with extracellular minerals remain unclear. It also remains unclear how Geobacter spp. nanowires interact with the porin-cytochrome to transfer extracellular electron. In the future, studies could be focused on the mechanisms of bacterial U(VI) reduction and how to improve the efficiency and stability of uranium bioremediation. © 2020, Editorial Board of China Environmental Science.

Dust inhalation dose rates were predicted to be highest on the remediated site and decrease with an approximate inverse square to inverse cubic dependence with distance from the site. The annual dose above natural background to a hypothetical individual permanently occupying the remediated site (representing the worst case scenario for radionuclide in dust exposure) was estimated to be 5.3 × 10                             −3                              mSv.

In this study, palygorskite and hexadecyl trimethylammonium modified palygorskite were used to support iron nanoparticles. The electron microscopic study of the obtained materials is performed. Iron nanoparticles had a core–shell structure with the core being iron, and the shell consisting of iron (hydr)oxides were detected by X-ray diffraction patterns. The sorption of uranium(VI) and cobalt(II) ions from contaminated waters using nanodispersed reactive active material on the basis of modified surfactant of clay mineral were investigated. The reduction of U(VI) and Co(II) was highest with HDTMA-palygorskite/iron particles, followed by palygorskite/iron particles and free iron nanoparticles. It has been shown that the efficiency of removal of metal ions is substantially influenced by the pH of the aqueous medium, the content of surfactant and the amount of immobilized nanosized Fe0 on the surface of the palygorskite. The influence of iron in the composite on its sorption properties was investigated. It has been found that the optimum content of Fe in the composite for the extraction of Co(II) and U(VI) ions from aqueous solutions is 10 % of the mass of the sorbent. The processes of aging of composites and loss of reactivity with respect to Co(II) ions are studied. The possibility of their use in the purification of groundwater with the use of modern environmental technologies is shown. It has been found that the composite sorbent exhibits the best sorption properties in relation to both uranium(VI) and cobalt(II), rather than pure nanosized iron, due to the increase of its dispersion due to the decrease in the agglomeration of nanosized iron particles and the increase in the specific surface area of the modified specimens. The presence of organo-palygorskite apparently decreased the extent of aggregation and the size of the iron particles. The prospect of using composites based on palygorskite and organopalygorskite with a layer applied Fe0 for the effective removal of heavy metal ions and radionuclides from aqueous media has been established. © 2019 Editorial Office of Journal of Third Military Medical University},

	abstract = {Despite significant technological advancements in the field of microbial ecology, cultivation and subsequent isolation of the vast majority of environmental microorganisms continues to pose challenges. Isolation of the environmental microbiomes is prerequisite to better understand a myriad of ecosystem services they provide, such as bioremediation of contaminants. Towards this end, in this culturomics study, we evaluated the colonization of soil bacterial and fungal communities within diffusion chambers (DC) and microbial traps (MT) established using uraniferous soils collected from a historically contaminated soil from Aiken, USA. Microbial assemblages were compared between the DC and MT relative to the native soils using amplicon based metagenomic and bioinformatic analysis. The overall rationale of this study is that DC and MT growth chambers provide the optimum conditions under which desired microbiota, identified in a previous study to serve as the “core” microbiomes, will proliferate, leading to their successful isolation. Specifically, the core microbiomes consisted of assemblages of bacteria (Burkholderia spp.) and fungi (Penicillium spp.), respectively. The findings from this study further supported previous data such that the abundance and diversity of the desired “core” microbiomes significantly increased as a function of enrichments over three consecutive generations of DC and MT, respectively. Metagenomic analysis of the DC/MT generations also revealed that enrichment and stable populations of the desired “core” bacterial and fungal microbiomes develop within the first 20 days of incubation and the practice of subsequent transfers for second and third generations, as is standard in previous studies, may be unnecessary. As a cost and time cutting measure, this study recommends running the DC/MT chambers for only a 20-day time period, as opposed to previous studies, which were run for months. In summation, it was concluded that, using the diffusion chamber-based enrichment techniques, growth of desired microbiota possessing environmentally relevant functions can be achieved in a much shorter time frame than has been previously shown. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Uranium phytoextraction is a promising technology, however, facing difficult that limited plant biomass due to nutrient deficiency in the contaminated sites. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of a symbiotic associations of a legume Sesbania rostrata, rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF) for reclamation of uranium contaminated soils. Results showed AMF and rhizobia had a mutual beneficial relations in the triple symbiosis, which significantly increased plant biomass and uranium accumulation in S. rostrata plant. The highest uranium removal rates was observed in plant-AMF-rhizobia treated soils, in which 50.5–73.2% had been extracted, whereas 7.2–23.3% had been extracted in plant-treated soil. Also, the S. rostrata phytochelatin synthase (PCS) genes expression were increased in AMF and rhizobia plants compared with the plants. Meantime, content of malic acid, succinic acid and citric acid were elevated in S. rostrata root exudates of AMF and rhizobia inoculated plants. The facts suggest that the mutual interactions in the triple symbiosis help to improve phytoremediation efficiency of uranium by S. rostrata. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The present study explores a novel application of Huma-K, a commercially available, unrefined humic substance, as a promising low-cost source of organic matter for in situ remediation of contaminated acidic groundwater plumes. This can be achieved by creating a humic-rich coating on the surface of minerals which can enhance the sorption of contaminants from groundwater. Huma-K was characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared analysis, and potentiometric titrations. Batch experiments were performed to investigate the sorption-desorption behavior of Huma-K and to evaluate what conditions (pH, contact time, and initial Huma-K concentration) affect these processes upon injection into aquifer sediments. As evidenced by potentiometric titrations, Huma-K possesses functional groups that have an acidic nature, with pK values in the range of 4–6 (carboxylic) and 9–10 (phenolic). Sorption, homogeneous precipitation, and surface-induced precipitation seem to be favored in the presence of sediment at pH 4, where there is less deprotonation of acidic functional groups. As the pH is increased, functional groups become negatively charged, leading to electrostatic repulsion and dissolution of Huma-K from sediment. Kinetic experiments indicate that Huma-K sorption is a slow-rate process, most likely governed by film diffusion. The enhanced sorption of Huma-K in acidic conditions suggests that it may be used to create a subsurface treatment zone in acidic aquifers for the sequestration of contaminants such as uranium. The treatment zone will persist as long as the pH does not increase sufficiently to cause soil-bound Huma-K to be released, remobilizing aqueous contaminants. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Electrokinetic-enhanced phytoremediation is an effective technology to decontaminate heavy metal contaminated soil. In this study, we examined the effects of electrokinetic treatments on plant uptake and bioaccumulation of U from soils with various U sources. Redistribution of uranium in soils as affected by planting and electrokinetic treatments was investigated. The soil was spiked with 100 mg kg–1 UO2, UO3, and UO2(NO3)2. After sunflower and Indian mustard grew for 60 days, 1 voltage of direct-current was applied across the soils for 9 days. The results indicated that U uptake in both plants were significantly enhanced by electrokinetic treatments from soil with UO3 and UO2(NO3)2. U was more accumulated in roots than in shoots. Electrokinetic treatments were effective on lowering soil pH near the anode region. Overall, uranium (U) removal efficiency reached 3.4–4.3% from soils with UO3 and uranyl with both plants while that from soil with UO2 was 0.7–0.8%. Electrokinetic remediation treatment significantly enhanced the U removal efficiency (5–6%) from soils with UO3 and uranyl but it was 0.8–1.3% from soil with UO2, indicating significant effects of U species and electrokinetic enhancement on U bioaccumulation. This study implies the potential feasibility of electrokinetic-enhanced phytoremediation of U soils with sunflower and Indian mustard. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The chelates followed the order CA > EDDS > OA in terms of the enhancement on uranium uptake by M. cordata. The repeated applications of the chelates were found to be more effective than the one time application at the equal dose as the U concentration of soil solution increased significantly from the 8th to 14th day. The repeated applications of 10 mmol kg                             -1                              CA promoted the solubilization of U in the U-contaminated soil by significantly decreasing the pH of soil solution, achieved the maximum U concentration of soil solution (1463.6 µg L                             −1                             ), bioconcentration factors (BCFs, 11.4), bioaccumulation factors (BAFs, 21.4) and transfer factors (TFs, 1.9), which were 215.2, 5.7, 30.6 and 16.3 times as compared with the control group, respectively. The three applied chelates significantly affected the activities of the antioxidant enzymes in the leaves. Repeated applications of CA further enhanced the activities of the antioxidant enzymes in the leaves of M. cordata as compared with the control, EDDS and OA, mitigated the oxidative stress induced by uranium and chelates, and maximized the enhancement on the uranium uptake, which will be beneficial for the enhancement on the phytoremediation of uranium contaminated soil by U hyperaccumulating plants. These results indicated that the phytoavailability of uranium in soil solution as well as the accumulation of U by M. cordata were both significantly increased after repeated applications of CA, and that the repeated applications of 10 mmol kg                             -1                              CA increased the activities of the antioxidant enzymes and promoted U accumulation by M. cordata.

	abstract = {Redox oscillation is commonly found in near-surface environment, where soils are often polluted with many redox active contaminants, including uranium (U). In order to investigate the transformation of U species in near-surface soil under redox oscillations conditions, redox oscillations and reduction experiments were performed, biogeochemical parameters and native microbial community composition were monitored, main elements on the surface of solid-phase were analyzed by XPS, and labile U(IV) species and stable U(IV) species in solid-phase were provisionally defined using an anoxic 1 M sodium bicarbonate extraction. It was found that redox oscillations slightly increased the water-soluble U but significantly increased the stable U(IV) species (P < 0.05) in soil. In reduction experiment, there was upper limit value for percentage of stable U(IV) species, and the labile U(IV) species could not transform to stable U(IV) species in a short period of time under reduction conditions. The redox transition of Fe enriched on the surface of soil and the conversion of microbial community composition played a major role in speciation transformation of U under redox oscillations conditions. In addition, sequential extraction revealed that the increase of stable U(IV) species content reflected the U speciation transition from acetate extract to more recalcitrant hydroxylamine extract. The finding provides a potential method for improving the stability of U when bio-reduction is used to remediate the U-contaminated soils. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Uranium (U) contamination is a major environmental problem associated with the mining and processing of nuclear materials for both weapons and power production. When possible, in situ soil remediation techniques are preferable for reducing the risk associated with diffuse low-level U contamination. Uranium is known to form sparingly soluble phosphate compounds that persist in the environment. Therefore, batch experiments were performed to evaluate the efficacy of three phosphate amendments, hydroxyapatite (HA), sodium phytate (IP6) and sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP), to immobilize U in contaminated sediments. The amendments were added at equivalent phosphorus (P) concentrations and then equilibrated under a range of test conditions, with changes in soluble U and Ptotal monitored at pre-set time intervals. Only HA was effective at reducing the soluble U soil fraction when compared to the control, with IP6 and TPP increasing the soluble U soil fraction. After equilibration, changes in contaminant partitioning in the amended sediments were evaluated using operational extraction methods. Sequential extraction results for HA generally indicated a transfer of U from labile to more recalcitrant phases, while the results for IP6 and TPP were more ambiguous. © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {In this study, the content of U, Th, Pb, V, Rb, and Ag in 19 soil samples from unpolluted Goc Mountain area (Serbia) was determined. The same elements were determined in 19 Macrolepiota procera samples, separately for caps and stipes. Soil samples were subjected to the BCR sequential extraction procedure. Element contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Obtained soil values for U were in the range from 0.30 to 0.86 mg/kg and for Th from 1.7 to 13.2 mg/kg. These values are the first for background levels at unpolluted Goc area, and they are lower than the corresponding values for European unpolluted soil. The mean values in soil for Pb, V, Rb, and Ag were 27.6, 57.4, 15.8, and 0.76 mg/kg, respectively. PCAwas applied to establish criteria for translocation of the analyzed elements between two parts of the mushroom. Efficient translocation for all elements except Ag as the main amount of the elements was found in caps. The mean content in the caps for U and Th was 4.3 and 63 μg/kg, respectively. Bioconcentration factors were much higher than 1 only for Rb and Ag. M. procera only weakly accumulates U and Th from soil in unpolluted areas.

Remediation of metals in actual soil confronts many challenges, remaining poorly understood. This study intends to investigate the concentrations and distributions of U, Cd, Zn, Pb, and Cu in soils surrounded by a uranium mill tailing pond. Furthermore, a phosphorus-modified bio-char was prepared in order to determine its role in immobilizing uranium in soil samples. Results show that the contents of U and Pb are much higher than that of the background values, due to the influence of the uranium mill tailing pond. Phosphorus can enhance the immobilization efficiency of U, Cd, Pb, and Cu in soil samples. The concentration of uranium in the leaching supernatant of phosphorus-modified bio-char group is lower than that of control and unmodified bio-char groups due to the fact that the biosorption occurred in the exterior surface of the biomass, which imply that phosphorus-modified bio-char is a potential immobilization material to reduce the leaching rate of metals. These findings can provide references for remediation technology of metals in natural soil. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

A radioactive hot spot was discovered in a village near the mining office, where specific activity of 238U, 226Ra, 232Th and 137Cs of soil was as high as 1433 ± 76 Bq/kg, 1210 ± 62 Bq/kg, 236 ± 13 Bq/kg and 17 ± 1.1 Bq/kg, respectively. The dose rate on a waste rock heap was about 2423 nGy/h. Approximately 50% of the houses in a village near the uranium mining site had radon concentrations that exceeded 160 Bq/m3. There was a significant positive correlation between indoor radon concentration and outdoor gamma dose rate (R2 = 0.7876). The abnormal radon concentration was observed in a rising spring sample providing residents with tap water up to 127.1 Bq/l. Four tap water samples and three of five well water samples exceeded the limit of radon concentration of drinking water in China (11.1 Bq/l). The mean annual effective doses from gamma dose rate data were 0.86 mSv/y and 1.13 mSv/y for indoor radon. The study shows that there are some radioactively contaminated places surrounding the Xiangshan uranium mine.

	abstract = {Being known with its agricultural fertility, the soil of the Nile Valley of Egypt was subjected to degradation due to fast urbanization and increased industrial activities in recent years. The quality of the agricultural soil and associated radiological health hazards to farm workers in the Northeastern Nile Valley was assessed based on the trace metal analyses (Hg, Cd, Zn, Pb, Cu, Mn, and Fe) and natural radionuclide measurements (238U, 226Ra, 232Th, 40K, and 210Pb) of twenty soil samples. Results indicated that the agricultural soil has concentrations of trace elements below the soil world average. However, a significant enrichment in Cd and Cu content was observed in some soil sites. The enrichment in some trace elements contents, especially the Cd metal, was attributed to the effects of the natural and human factors, including the occurrence and distribution of silt and clay deposits, the extensive use of municipal wastewater and pesticide, the incineration of agricultural wastes, and the emission from bricks factories and mazut-fired thermal power plants around the area. The estimated contamination and ecologic risk indices revealed that some soils in the area are uncontaminated with trace elements; others are “moderately contaminated” soil to “contaminated.” Results from the radiological measurements revealed that the activity concentrations of the investigated radionuclides were also below the world median activities of soil. The total annual effective dose rates from the different exposure pathways were calculated. The estimated excess lifetime cancer risk values for farm workers were greatly higher than that of the soil world average. This implies a high probability of introducing cancer over the lifetime of farmers in the study area. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Goethite is a common iron hydroxide, which can be substituted by manganese (Mn) in the goethite structure. It is important to investigate the immobilization of uranium(VI) on Mn-substituted goethite (Mn-Goe) to understand the fate and migration of uranium in soils and sediments. In this study, the sorption of uranium(VI) by Mn-Goe was investigated as a function of pH, adsorbent dosage, contact time, and initial uranium concentration in batch experiments. Several material analysis techniques were used to characterize manganese substituted materials. Results indicated that Mn was successfully introduced into the goethite structure, the length of particles increased gradually, the surface clearly exhibited higher roughness with increasing Mn content, and that uranium(VI) sorption of synthetic Mn-Goe appeared to be higher than that of goethite. The sorption kinetics supported the results presented by the pseudo-second-order model. The sorption capacity of uranium on Mn-Goe was circa 77 mg g−1 at pH = 4.0 and 25 °C. Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analyses revealed that uranium ions were adsorbed through functional groups containing oxygen on the Mn-Goe structure. The enhancement of Mn-substitution for the uranium(VI) sorption capacity of goethite was revealed. This study suggests that goethite and Mn-Goe can both play a significant role in controlling the mobility and transport of uranium(VI) in the subsurface environment, which is helpful for material development in environmental remediation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The authors sampled and analyzed 15 species of dominant wild plants in Huanan uranium tailings pond in China, whose tailings' uranium contents were 3.21–120.52 μg/g. Among the 15 species of wild plants, ramie (Boehmeria nivea) had the strongest uranium bioconcentration and transfer capacities. In order to study the uranium bioconcentration and tolerance attributes of ramie in detail, and provide a reference for the screening remediation plants to phytoremedy on a large scale in uranium tailings pond, a ramie cultivar Xiangzhu No. 7 pot experiment was carried out. We found that both wild ramie and Xiangzhu No. 7 could bioconcentrate uranium, but there were two differences. One was wild ramie's shoots bioconcentrated uranium up to 20 μg/g (which can be regarded as the critical content value of the shoot of uranium hyperaccumulator) even the soil uranium content was as low as 5.874 μg/g while Xiangzhu No. 7's shoots could reach 20 μg/g only when the uranium treatment concentrations were 275 μg/g or more; the other was that all the transfer factors of 3 wild samples were >1, and the transfer factors of 27 out of 28 pot experiment samples were <1. Probably wild ramie was a uranium hyperaccumulator. Xiangzhu No. 7 satisfied the needs of uranium hyperaccumulator on accumulation capability, tolerance capability, bioconcentration factor, but not transfer capability, so Xiangzhu No. 7 was not a uranium hyperaccumulator. We analyzed the possible reasons why there were differences in the uranium bioconcentration and transfer attributes between wild ramie and Xiangzhu No. 7., and proposed the direction for further research. In our opinion, both the plants which bioconcentrate contaminants in the shoots and roots can act as phytoextractors. Although Xiangzhu No. 7's biomass and accumulation of uranium were concentrated on the roots, the roots were small in volume and easy to harvest. And Xiangzhu No. 7's cultivating skills and protection measures had been developed very well. Xiangzhu No. 7's whole bioconcentration factors and the roots' bioconcentration factors, which were 1.200–1.834 and 1.460–2.341, respectively, increased with the increases of uranium contents of pot soil when the soil's uranium contents are 25–175 μg/g, so it can act as a potential phytoextractor when Huanan uranium tailings pond is phytoremediated. © 2018},

The effects of different electrolyte and the concentrations of FeCl3 on migration behavior of U(VI) and environmental risks were investigated after EK remediation. The result showed that the optimum concentration was 0.1 mol/L CA mixed with 0.03 mol/L FeCl3 in this study.

	abstract = {The capability of microorganisms to alter metal speciation offers potential for the development of new strategies for immobilization of toxic metals in the environment. A metal-reducing microbe, "Pelosinus lilae" strain UFO1, was isolated under strictly anaerobic conditions from an Fe(III)-reducing enrichment established with uncontaminated soil from the Department of Energy Oak Ridge Field Research Center, Tennessee. "P. lilae" UFO1 is a rod-shaped, spore-forming, and Gram-variable anaerobe with a fermentative metabolism. It is capable of reducing the humic acid analog anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) using a variety of fermentable substrates and H2. Reduction of Fe(III)-nitrilotriacetic acid occurred in the presence of lactate as carbon and electron donor. Ferrihydrite was not reduced in the absence of AQDS. Nearly complete reduction of 1, 3, and 5 ppm Cr(VI) occurred within 24 h in suspensions containing 108 cells mL-1 when provided with 10 mM lactate; when 1 mM AQDS was added, 3 and 5 ppm Cr(VI) were reduced to 0.1 ppm within 2 h. Strain UFO1 is a novel species within the bacterial genus Pelosinus, having 98.16% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with the most closely related described species, Pelosinus fermentans R7T. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 38 mol%, and DNA-DNA hybridization of "P. lilae" UFO1 against P. fermentans R7T indicated an average 16.8% DNA-DNA similarity. The unique phylogenetic, physiologic, and metal-transforming characteristics of "P. lilae" UFO1 reveal it is a novel isolate of the described genus Pelosinus. © 2018 Ray, Connon, Neal, Fujita, Cummings, Ingram and Magnuson.},

	abstract = {It has generally been assumed that the immobilization of U(VI) via polyphosphate accumulating microorganisms may present a sink for uranium, but the potential mechanisms of the process and the stability of precipitated uranium under aerobic conditions remain elusive. This study seeks to explore the mechanism, capacity, and stability of uranium precipitation under aerobic conditions by a purified indigenous bacteria isolated from acidic tailings (pH 6.5) in China. The results show that over the treatment ranges investigated, maximum removal of U(VI) from aqueous solution was 99.82% when the initial concentration of U(VI) was 42 μM, pH was 3.5, and the temperature was with 30 °C much higher than that of other reported microorganisms. The adsorption mechanism was elucidated via the use of SEM-EDS, XPS and FTIR. SEM-EDS showed two peaks of uranium on the surface. A plausible explanation for this, supported by FTIR, is that uranium precipitated on the biosorbent surfaces. XPS measurements indicated that the uranium product is most likely a mixture of 13% U(VI) and 87% U(IV). Notably, the reoxidation experiment found that the uranium precipitates were stable in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+, however, U(IV) is oxidized to U(VI) in the presence of NO3                             − and Na+ ions, resulting in rapid dissolution. It implies that the synthesized Leifsonia sp. coated biochar could be utilized as a green and effective biosorbent. However, it may not a good choice for in-situ remediation due to the subsequent re-oxidation under aerobic conditions. These observations can be of some guiding significance to the application of the bioremediation technology in surface environments. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {A composite electrolyte with citric acid and ferric chloride was used to study the effects of different electrolyte concentrations on U(VI) migration behavior and energy efficiency. The results revealed the optimal concentration combination was 0.1mol/L for citric acid, and 0.03mol/L for FeCl3. The corresponding removal efficiency of uranium was about (61.55±0.41)%, the cumulative energy consumption was 0.2559kW∙h, and the energy utilization ratio β was (0.24±0.02)×103. Visual MNIETQ software was further used to simulate theaqueous U speciation in citric acid and ferric chloride solutions at pH 3.0. The results showed that a large amount of uranium-citrate complex (UO2-Citrate-) and a small amount of uranyl ion (UO2 2+) existed in the process, and uranium mainly migrated from cathode to anode. When the concentration of ferric chloride increased to 0.05mol/L, the removal rate of uranium decreased correspondingly. This phenomenon was related to the strength and direction of electroosmotic flow and the adsorption of colloidal hydroxide. Compared with single citric acid and hydrochloric acidelectrolyte, the electrolyte combined with citric acid and ferric chloride has the advantages of higher removal efficiency, lower leaching toxicity and little harm after electrokinetic (EK) remediation. © 2019, Editorial Board of China Environmental Science.

	abstract = {Air-borne dust affects all aspects of human life. The sources of dust have high spatial variation and a better quantification of dust emission helps to identify remediation measures. Orographic and statistical source functions allow a better estimation of dust emission fluxes in coarse-scale modeling, but a high-resolution source function is necessary to represent the highly heterogeneous nature of dust sources at the finer scale. Here we use a newly developed high-resolution (~500 m) source function in Weather Research and Forecasting model, coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) to simulate dust emission over the Middle East and North Africa and evaluate our simulated results against observations. Using a 4-km grid spacing, we also simulate the emission and transport of dust originating from the Tigris-Euphrates basin, one of the most important regional dust sources, and quantify the effects of this source on the air quality of the entire Arabian Peninsula. Results show that the use of new source function effectively represents the key dust sources and provides reasonable estimates of dust optical depth and concentrations. We find that the atmospheric dust originating from the Tigris-Euphrates basin alone exceeds the particulate matter 10 air quality standards in several downwind cities. Our results have broader environmental implications and indicate that the mobilization of depleted uranium deposited in Kuwait and Southern Iraq during the Gulf War (1991) could potentially affect the urban centers over the peninsula, albeit in low concentrations. Our results suggest that an integrated and coordinated management of the Tigris-Euphrates basin is necessary to maintain good air quality across the Arabian Peninsula. © 2019. The Authors.},

The mobility and bioavailability of U are influenced by its sources, speciation, and plant species. Phytoremediation has emerged as an environmentally friendly, cost-effective green technology to remediate radioisotope- and metal-contaminated soils. The main objective of this study was to explore the feasibility using sunflower (Helianthus annuus) and Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) in cleaning up soils with UO2, UO3, and UO2(NO3)2. Uranium was found to be bioaccumulated in plant roots more than plant shoots. Uranium uptake by both plant species was significantly higher from the UO3- and uranyl-contaminated soils than from UO2-contaminated soils. UO3- and UO2(NO3)2-contaminated soils showed higher exchangeable, weak acid extractable, and labile U than the UO2-contaminated soils. After a growing season, three U forms decreased as redistribution/transformation of U resulted in U species with lower extractability. This study indicates the importance of U speciation in soil with regard to the potential use of sunflower and Indian mustard for phytoremediation of U-contaminated soils. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Measurements were made approximately one month after filling the columns and again after approximately one and two years. The average 222Rn diffusion length derived from the measurements was 1.9 ± 0.2 m in the dry material. The corresponding diffusion coefficient was (7.3 ± 0.7) × 10−6 m2 s−1. For an infinitely thick layer of the dry material, the average value of the 222Rn exhalation flux density relative to the 226Ra activity concentration was estimated as (5.3 ± 0.3) × 10−4 Bq m−2 s−1 per Bq kg−1.

	abstract = {Municipal and industrial wastewaters, manufacturing of electrical and electronic equipment, etc., are spreading toxic heavy metals such as lead, arsenic, zinc, nickel, cadmium, uranium, and mercury in the aquatic and soil environment. There are some traditional treatment technologies to remove heavy metals from drinking water and wastewater. However, conventional treatment technologies are expensive and not always efficient for the treatment of wastewaters with high metal concentration. Furthermore, these methods need more chemicals and energy and produce toxic sludge. By contrast, bioremediation by biosorption process using biosorbents is a low-cost, highly efficient, easy operating, eco-friendly, and sustainable green technology for the removal of heavy metals from wastewater. The renewable biocomposite biosorbent materials can be prepared from plant biomass; agricultural wastes such as fruit peels, straw, and coconut coir; bacteria; yeasts; fungi; and algae. The main mechanisms of biosorption process involve ion exchange, surface complexation, adsorption, absorption, and precipitation methods. Biosorption has several benefits, such as selective removal of metals, biosorbent regeneration and metal recovery, rapid kinetics of adsorption and desorption, and no sludge generation. The biosorbent materials can be modified by different physical and chemical treatments and other treatments to prepare novel adsorbents and remove nanoparticle heavy metal contaminants from wastewater. The biosorbents without treatment have shown low adsorption capacity. The chemical pretreatments significantly improved the adsorption capacities of biosorbents by increasing the number of binding sites, ion-exchange ability, and new functional groups. The main composition of plant biomass and agricultural waste consists of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin containing different functional groups, such as hydroxyl groups, acetamido, carboxyl, phenolic, structural polysaccharides, amido, amino, sulfhydryl and carboxyl groups, alcohols, and ester. Some important physical and chemical factors influencing the biosorption of heavy metals from wastewater are pH, temperature, initial heavy metal concentration, biosorbent dose, biosorbent size, ionic strength, and coions. Nanoparticle heavy metals can be recovered from the biosorbents by physical treatment such as heating, stirring, and agitation or chemical treatments. The chemical treatments use the chemicals as eluents that include acid, alkali, and organic solvent. © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We studied the accumulation process of uranium and several other heavy metals, as well as their actual chemical forms in plant tissues, in Polygonum viviparum and Rumex nepalensis, which are dominant Polygonaceae plant species growing in the remediation area of the Zogie uranium mine. The results of this study will contribute to a better understanding of heavy metal absorption and tolerance by plants around polluted areas, which is important for improving remediation efficiency. The composition of heavy metals in P. viviparum and R. nepalensis were analyzed through field sampling. Their subsequent extraction from the sample using a special chemical separation method allowed to determine their chemical nature regarding their qualitative state of binding in the plant. The results showed that the soil in the remediation area was polluted by U, Cd, As, Zn, and Cu. The areas of contamination in declining order is as follows: I (open-pit mining site) > II (artificial restoration area) > III (affiliated river). Single factor index and Nemerow comprehensive pollution index showed that serious heavy metal pollution existed in open-pit mining sites and artificial restoration areas. Furthermore, Zn, Cd, Cu, and Pb in the plant samples exceeded the normal values. The bio-enrichment coefficient (BCF) and transfer factor (TF) of R. nepalensis were determined to be 16.03 and 1.11, respectively, and in P. viviparum, the values were 14.85 and 3.83, respectively. This indicates that both plants are suitable for use in ecological remediation of uranium-contaminated soil. Because uranium in R. nepalensis was mainly extracted with deionized water, organic acids might be the complexing ligand for uranium in the plants. For the other heavy metals, acetate and hydrochloric acid were mainly needed for their extraction from R. nepalensis, which means that they should have stronger ligands. In contrast, most of the heavy metals in P. viviparum could be extracted with hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, and sodium chloride. Both P. viviparum and R. nepalensis could be used for heavy metal remediation around a uranium mine. The plants show good tolerance and absorption properties for uranium and other heavy metals, such as Cd, in the investigated remediation area. The heavy metals found in these plants mentioned above are relatively strongly bound to their ligands, which indicates that both Polygonaceae plant species can cope with uranium and other heavy metal stressors. © 2019 Science Press.

	abstract = {Thousands of former uranium mining sites in the United States, primarily in the southwestern states of Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah, are being identified and evaluated to assess their potential for causing public and environmental impacts. The common radiological contaminant of concern that characterizes these sites is naturally occurring uranium ore and associated wastes that may have been left behind postmining. The majority of these sites were abandoned and in general, are referred to as abandoned uranium mines, regardless of the government authority currently managing the land or in some cases, assigned responsibility for the oversight of assessment and remediation. The U.S. Department of Energy has identified over 4,000 defense-related uranium mine sites from which uranium ore was purchased by the U.S. government for nuclear defense programs prior to 1970. U.S. Department of Energy has established a program to inventory and perform environmental screening on defense-related uranium mine sites. The focus of this paper is the approximately 2,400 defense-related uranium mine sites located on federal land managed by the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service. This paper presents the results of an analysis to develop radiological screening criteria for U.S. Department of Energy's defense-related uranium mine sites that can be used as input to the overall ranking of these sites for prioritization of additional assessment, reclamation, or remedial actions. For these sites managed by Bureau of Land Management, public access is typically limited to short-term use, primarily for recreational purposes. This is a broad category that can cover a range of possible activities, including camping, hiking, hunting, biking, all-terrain vehicle use, and horseback riding. The radiological screening levels were developed by calculating the radiological dose to future recreational users of defense-related uranium mine sites assuming a future camper spends two weeks per year at the site engaged in recreational activities. Although a number of possible exposure pathways were included in this analysis (inhalation and ingestion of dust and soil, radon and progeny inhalation, and gamma radiation exposure from the soil), it is desirable as a practical matter to determine what gamma exposure rate would ensure that the annual acceptable exposure as determined by the regulatory authority will not be exceeded in the future. Because these sites are generally remote and located in semiarid environments, traditional exposure scenarios often applied in these types of analyses (e.g., subsistent farmers and ranchers), including exposure pathways for the ingestion of locally grown food products and water, were not considered relevant to short-term recreational use. © Copyright 2018 Health Physics Society.},

	abstract = {Red mud or bauxite residue is a solid waste generated from the Bayer process. The disposal of red mud leads to a serious environmental threat because of its tiny particle size and high alkaline value. The utilisation and recycling of red mud is currently a crucial issue and needs to be addressed as soon as possible. This study demonstrates the different methods and techniques recently analysed or suggested for the consumption of bulk red mud to maintain a sustainable environment. The potential utilisations of red mud include valuable metal recovery, the preparation of construction materials and as an alternative catalyst for diverse processes, including hydrodechlorination, hydrogenation and hydrocarbon oxidation. In addition, the red mud can also be used to control environmental pollution, such as in wastewater treatment, soil remediation and the puriﬁcation of flue gas. However, the proper utilisation and recycling of red mud has a number of shortcomings: pyro-metallurgical recovery involves high energy costs; large volumes of acid by-product needing to be neutralised after the leaching process; the fine particle size of red mud; and the necessity of pre-treatment in some methods. Although many studies have investigated the potential utilisation of red mud, most of them have concentrated on lab-scale studies. Therefore, a large-scale investigation of the recycling and utilisation of red mud needs to be explored. Moreover, an appropriate cost-benefit analysis of the existing technologies needs to be examined in the future because of the high cost of the transportation of a large amount of red mud from alumina refineries to the point of application. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Furthermore, most of the extracted uranium was removed from the waste solution by precipitation, implying that the treated solution can be reused as washing solution.

	abstract = {Organic matter is increasingly shown to influence the mobility of uranium (U) in the environment. The mobility of U likely depends on whether the organic matter is in dissolved or solid form, with the latter able to retard U mobility. In this work, column experiments were used to reveal that solid organic matter, in the form of well characterized tree bark from Eucalyptus globulus, dramatically reduced the mobility of aqueous U(VI) which was introduced as uranyl nitrate [UO2(NO3)2]. Eucalyptus globulus bark contains high levels of carboxylic and phenolic acid groups which are known to bind to U. Admixtures containing 20 wt. % tree bark and sand were compared to columns containing sand only. We show that soluble U is adsorbed onto the tree bark, likely via a cation exchange with calcium, with no change in U oxidation state as confirmed by X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) analyses. Cation concentrations in column outflow solutions indicated that U was retained in the columns containing tree bark but was released from the sand-only columns. These results demonstrate that solid organic matter such as tree bark has potential applications in trapping U, possibly within permeable reactive barriers, without necessitating further engineering to reduce U(VI) to U(IV). Building on previous work on organic sedimentary U-deposits, this study also helps understand processes of U enrichment from groundwater as observed in environments high in organic matter including wetlands and sediment-hosted ore deposits. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Mineralogical analysis and characterization was carried out using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The results obtained showed that the average activity concentrations of 238U, 232Th and 40K ranges from BDL↔76.00 ± 12.00, BDL↔204.48 ± 13.02 and BDL↔755.6 ± 40.15 Bqkg−1 respectively. Eleven other radiological and hazard parameters were estimated to know the complete hazardous nature of the samples. The values obtained for radionuclides and all its associated radiological and health hazard parameters were all higher than the world's average set by UNSCEAR. Five different minerals were identified and characterized as major and minor minerals. The mean radionuclides activity concentrations, radium equivalent and dose rate of measured radionuclides were compared with other literature values. RESRAD computer code was used to calculate the probability of excess lifetime cancer incurred by dwellers of the tar-sand deposit site, the level of which was determined to be 2.3 × 10−3 ([Formula presented]). Spatial distribution of natural radionuclides in the study area was also investigated for radioactivity disequilibrium. Multivariate statistics were applied to establish the effect of mineralogy on radionuclides activity. Therefore, the tar-sand soil samples are considered to pose serious radiological hazard and cancer risk to human through the multiple routes of exposure and significant soil remediation action need to be taken for future use of the soils. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

An in-depth, genome-wide comparisons between strains 25, 46 and a previously isolated strain from our research (Burkholderia sp. strain SRS-W-2-2016), revealed a common pool of 3128 genes; many were found to be homologues to previously characterized metal resistance genes (e.g., for cadmium, cobalt, and zinc), as well as for transporter, stress/detoxification, cytochromes, and drug resistance functions. Furthermore, proteomic analysis of strains with or without U stress, revealed the increased expression of 34 proteins from strain SRS-25 and 52 proteins from strain SRS-46; similar to the genomic analyses, many of these proteins have previously been shown to function in stress response, DNA repair, protein biosynthesis and metabolism. Overall, this comparative proteogenomics study confirms the repertoire of metabolic and stress response functions likely rendering the ecological competitiveness to the isolated strains for colonization and survival in the heavy metals contaminated SRS soil habitat. © 2018 by the authors.

	abstract = {                             The environmental fate of major (e.g. C, N, S, Fe and Mn) and trace (e.g. As, Cr, Sb, Se and U) elements is governed by microbially catalysed reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions. Mesocosms are routinely used to elucidate trace metal fate on the basis of correlations between biogeochemical proxies such as dissolved element concentrations, trace element speciation and dissolved organic matter. However, several redox processes may proceed simultaneously in natural soils and sediments (particularly, reductive Mn and Fe dissolution and metal/metalloid reduction), having a contrasting effect on element mobility. Here, a novel redox-stat (R                             cont                             ) bioreactor allowed precise control of the redox potential (159 ± 11 mV, ~ 2 months), suppressing redox reactions thermodynamically favoured at lower redox potential (i.e. reductive mobilisation of Fe and As). For a historically contaminated mining soil, As release could be attributed to desorption of arsenite [As(III)] and Mn reductive dissolution. By contrast, the control bioreactor (R                             nat                             , with naturally developing redox potential) showed almost double As release (337 vs. 181 μg g                             −1                             ) due to reductive dissolution of Fe (1363 μg g                             −1                              Fe                             2+                              released; no Fe                             2+                              detected in R                             cont                             ) and microbial arsenate [As(V)] reduction (189 μg g                             −1                              released vs. 46 μg g                             −1                              As(III) in R                             cont                             ).

	abstract = {The Republic of Kazakhstan has a long history of mining activities, viz., gold and uranium. Mining activities represent sources of potential naturally occurring radionuclides contamination of the environment and human health of population. The aim of this study was to investigate the radiation situation of industrially modified environment in Stepnogorsk areas of Kazakhstan to understand the sources of contamination. Quite high values of ambient equivalent dose rates in air ~2.87 μSv h-1 were found in the Aqsu gold-mining site. The radon equivalent equilibrium volume activity (indoor) were in the range of 313-858 Bq m-3 in the study area buildings. The high values of activity concentration of natural radionuclides found in Aqsu soil samples were 226Ra-4060, 232Th-1170 and 40K-4080 Bq kg-1, respectively. However, our comprehensive surveys implied that the increased natural radiation background caused by the radionuclide transport from the tailing area did not have an impact, while evaluation of its potential radiation risks and remediation of the territories of the former gold mining should be needed. © The Author(s) 2020.

	abstract = {During the second half of the twentieth century, northwestern New Mexico served as the primary production site for one of the world's largest nuclear arsenals. From 1948 to 1970 the “Grants uranium district” provided almost half of the total uranium ore accumulated by the United States federal government for the production of nuclear weapons, in addition to becoming a national source for commercial nuclear energy from the late 1960s to the early 1990s. By the twenty-first century, after a prolonged period of economic decline that began in the late 1970s, all uranium mining and milling in New Mexico had ceased, leaving a legacy of environmental health impacts. What was once referred to as “The Uranium Capital of the World” now encompasses over a thousand abandoned uranium mines and seven massive uranium mill tailings piles, which are associated with airborne and soil contamination as well as groundwater plumes of uranium and other contaminants of concern, in a landscape that has been fractured by underground mine workings and punctured by thousands of exploratory boreholes. This article presents an ethnographic study of the diverse forms of expertise involved in monitoring and managing the mine waste and mill tailings. Drawing from over two years of ethnographic research, I describe the relationship between different stakeholders from local communities, government agencies, and transnational mining corporations as they deliberate about the possibility of cleaning up the former mining district. My thesis is that the possibility of cleaning up the Grants district hinges on the “politics of baselining”—a term I introduce to describe the relationship between stakeholders and their competing environmental models and hydrogeological theories; each accounts for a different geological past prior to mining that can be deemed “natural,” as the background against which to measure the anthropogenic impacts from mining. © 2020},

	abstract = {The microbial solubilization of metals in acid environments is productively used in industrial processes called bioleaching of ores or biomining, to extract metals such as copper, gold, and uranium. This is an important biotechnological procedure used in many countries that generates several hundred thousand tons a year of metals such as copper. In addition, acidophilic microorganisms mobilize metals and produce acid mine drainage, causing serious environmental problems. However, bioremediation or removal of the toxic metals from contaminated soils can be achieved by employing the specific properties of microorganisms interacting with metals. Current approaches to the study of microorganisms consider the microorganism or the community as a whole, integrating fundamental biological knowledge with genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and other data to obtain a global picture of how a microbial cell or a community functions. Understanding microbiological phenomena involved in bacteria-mineral interactions such as chemotaxis, quorum sensing, cyclic-bis(3',5') diguanylic acid (c-di-GMP) signaling, adhesion, biofilm formation, metals resistance, and biochemistry of iron and sulfur compounds, oxidation will be extremely useful in monitoring and controlling the microbial community to improve the biomining process, making it faster and more efficient. It is expected that the use of different selected or genetically engineered strains with the highest metal resistance values, oxidation capacities, and other enhanced factors of importance in bioleaching of ores will play a key role for industrial biomining in the next decades. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Nanoparticulate uraninite is found in natural settings such as ore deposits, U-contaminated soils and sediments associated with such natural deposits, spent nuclear fuel waste repositories, and uranium processing plants. Nanoparticulate UO2 may act as a significant carrier of U (IV) in various environments, including emissions from coal-fired power plants, U mine sediments and systems that have undergone U bioremediation. Reduction of U(VI) and precipitation of nanoparticulate UO2 can result from both abiotic and biological processes. Abiotic reduction generally proceeds by heterogeneous reduction at Fe (II) sites on the surfaces of Fe (II)-bearing minerals including biotite, magnetite and green rust. Bacteria mediate the reduction of U (VI) to nanoparticulate UO2 by enzymatically controlled process. In this case U (VI) is used as the terminal electron acceptor during cell metabolism of dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria. Bacterially mediated reduction of uranyl in natural sediments indicates that U (IV) is dominantly present in the form of nanometer-sized particles of UO2, on the order of 2–10 nm in diameter. Similar sizes are typical of formation of a UO2 crystalline nanophase in reduction of U (VI) to U (IV) by green rust. Organic matter coating on biogenic, nanoparticles of UO2 produced by the reduction of aqueous U (VI) by Shewanella putrefaciens, which could potentially affect the surface reactivity of biogenic, nanoparticulate UO2. The case-study of Anaeromyxobacter bacteria show that uraninite particles formed in sediments by bacterial reduction are typically less than 2 nm, which impedes their stabilization and increases mobility in oil, sediments and water solutions. Another way for the mobilization of the uranium (IV) is colloids formation. © 2020, "Ore and Metals" Publishing house. All rights reserved.},

The influence of As(V) on U(VI) immobilization by Mucor circinelloides (M. circinelloides) was investigated using batch experiments. The activity of antioxidative enzymes and concentrations of thiol compounds and organic acid in M. circinelloides increased to respond to different U(VI) and As(V) stress. The morphological structure of M. circinelloides changed obviously under U(VI) and As(V) stress by SEM and TEM analysis. The results of XANES and EXAFS analysis showed that U(VI) was mainly reduced to nano-uraninite (nano-UO2, 30.1%) in U400, while only 9.7% of nano-UO2 was observed in the presence of As(V) in U400-As400 due to the formation of uranyl arsenate precipitate (Trögerite, 48.6%). These observations will provide the fundamental data for fungal remediation of uranium and heavy metals in uranium-contaminated soils.

	abstract = {This study investigated the biogeochemistry of uranium (U), and the co-occurring elements nickel (Ni) and arsenic (As), in colloids and sediments from two meromictic mine pit lakes that have considerably different depths and geochemistry. In order to characterize the processes controlling metal speciation and cycling in the pits, the distribution and speciation of the elements in colloidal size fractions were analyzed using micro- and ultrafiltration in combination with transmission electron microscopy. Sediment traps collected fresh sediments over the course of one year below the chemocline of the pit lakes and were subsequently analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for morphology and chemical digestions. The most common particles found in the shallower pit consisted of Ca-O and Fe-O colloids, while the particles in the deeper pit were composed of Ca-S-O. Filtration results showed a higher abundance of metals in larger colloidal fractions in aged samples, suggesting that colloids can act as metal accumulators. Sediment traps showed the formation of Fe-O, Fe-S, Al-Si, and Ce-P phases, which were observed to sorb U and Ni. The overall U removal was calculated to be 0.9 g/m2/year in both pits, despite considerably different geochemical conditions between the two, and the maximum removal rates for As (shallow pit) and Ni (deeper pit) were 4.7 g/m2/year and 0.6 g/m2/year, respectively. Bottom sediments were also collected from both pits, and characterized using sequential extractions, SEM, synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy and Laue diffraction techniques. These techniques showed that the stability of metals in the sediment follows the order Ni < U < As. Nickel, found in the exchangeable and acid soluble fractions, could be easily mobilized by changes in aqueous ionic strength and pH. Similarly, pH and redox changes in the water may strongly affect U, due to its dominance in the acid soluble and reducible sediment fractions. U(VI) mineral phases confirmed by spectroscopy and Laue diffraction, such as vandendriesscheite and monazite, which were likely associated with the oxidizable sediment fraction, may increase overall U stability. Arsenic was more strongly bound to the sediments and mostly present in the oxidizable and residual (highly recalcitrant) fractions. The collective results demonstrate the importance of colloidal particles for metal sequestration processes and their potential importance on microbial communities in pit lakes, highlighting the need for improved characterization of colloids in environmental studies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Mining activity leads to several environmental impacts. After the closure, the realization of a holistic evaluation of the main ecosystem components and their environmental risks is essential in order to define and manage a sustainable rehabilitation program specific to the current environmental situation. The objective of this work was to evaluate the chemical quality of the soils and runoff waters of the uranium mine, Fé mine (Saelices el Chico, Spain), in order to establish a diagnosis of the existing environmental problems and potential recovery actions to apply. Soils located within the mining area and natural soils from adjacent areas were sampled, classified according to the World Reference Base and analysed for their physico-chemical properties. Moreover, runoff water samples were collected for chemical and thermodynamic evaluation as well as, in the dry period, salt efflorescences from surface materials for chemical and mineralogical analysis. The natural soils (classified as Lithic, Haplic and Skeletic Leptosols, Leptic and Haplic Cambisols, Plinthic Acrisols, and Haplic and Gleyic Fluvisols) have low fertility (evaluated by concentration of nutrients and organic matter) and a strong erosive tendency which, together with the climatic conditions of the area, lead to a poor vegetation cover development. These soils are very incipient and are only located in areas where there is a permanent vegetation cover. Most of the mine soils are developed on different mixtures of host rock and sulfide-rich wastes, being classified as Sulfidic or Salic Spolic Technosols, depending on their specific properties and/or conditions. These mixtures of materials diminish the negative effect of the mine wastes, since the total concentrations of potentially toxic elements are similar (except for Pb) between mine and natural soils. However, these mine soils present a high environmental risk due to the generation of leachates with hyper-acid (pH ≈ 2.8), hyper-oxidant (Eh ≈ 759 mV) and hyper-conductor (EC ≈ 12.8 dS m-1) characteristics and with potentially high toxic elements (e.g. Al, Fe and Mn) and sulfates (22.9-33.9 g L-1). In the dry period, the ascension of the soil solution rich in elements contributes to the formation of evaporitic salts on the materials which were mainly identified as Al and Mg sulfates (epsomite and halotrichite). These solid phases are only temporary sinks of sulfate and metals, since they are re-dissolved with rain, releasing the elements to the environment. Moreover, the low fertility and cation exchange capacity, high acidity, stoniness and salinity of the mine soils limit the natural colonization and vegetative development. Considering the environmental risk and characteristics/conditions of the mine soils, the recovery process of the Fé mine should focus, mainly, on the sulfide oxidation minimization and fertility improvement in order to promote the establishment of a biodiverse plant cover as well as pedogenetic and biogeochemical processes. © 2020, Universia.

	abstract = {To explore the effects of chelating agent on the phytoremediation in U and Cd contaminated soil, a pot experiment was performed to study the effects of 3 chelating agents (EDDS, OA and CA) and their additive concentrations (0.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 mmol/kg) on U and Cd extraction, translocation, and accumulation in Zebrina pendula. The results show that the growth of Zebrina pendula is affected by the type and concentration of chelating agents. The addition of 7.5 mmol/kg EDDS inhibits the growth of Zebrina pendula. The application of 2.5 mmol/kg OA and CA increases the net weight of Zebrina pendula. The chelating agents have a positive effect on the uptake and translocation of U and Cd in Zebrina pendula. Applying 5.0 mmol/kg CA, the U content maximally increases by 5.68 times of control check, with levels of 205.9 mg/kg attained. Applying 5.0 mmol/kg EDDS, the Cd content maximally increases by 2.65 times of control check, with levels of 47.03 mg/kg attained. The maximum value of the U translocation factor is 0.342 when CA concentration is 7.5 mmol/kg, which is 2.36 times of that of control check. EDDS could better improve the translocation factor of Cd. Based on the results of U and Cd bioaccumulation, it is concluded that CA has the greatest effect on the accumulation of U and also has effect on that of Cd, EDDS has effect on the accumulation of Cd, while OA has no effect on the accumulation of U and Cd. The addition of CA and EDDS respectively enhances the available contents of U and Cd in soil. These results suggest that chelating agents could improve the effectiveness of phytoremediation with Zebrina pendula in soil contaminated with U and Cd. © 2018, Editorial Board of Atomic Energy Science and Technology.

	abstract = {                             It has become increasingly apparent that the environmental microorganisms residing in uranium (U) enriched sites offer the possibility of understanding the biological mechanisms catalyzing the processes important for uranium bioremediation. Here, we present the results of uranium biomineralization over a wide pH range by a metal tolerant Serratia sp. Strain OT II 7 isolated from the subsurface soil of a U ore deposit at Domiasiat in India. The Serratia cells actively expressed acid and alkaline phosphatase enzymes which hydrolyzed differential amounts of phosphate from an organophosphate substrate in the presence of uranium between pH 5 to 9. These cells precipitated ∼91% uranium from aqueous solutions supplemented with 1 mM uranyl nitrate at pH 5 within 120 h. More rapid precipitation was observed at pH 7 and 9 wherein the cells removed ∼93-94% of uranium from solutions containing 1 mM uranyl carbonate within 24 h. The aqueous uranyl speciation prevalent under the studied pH conditions influenced the localization of crystalline uranyl phosphate precipitates, which in turn, impacted the cell viability to a great extent. Furthermore, the cells tolerated up to ∼1.6 kGy                              60                             Co gamma radiation and their uranium precipitation abilities at pH 5, 7 and 9 were uncompromised even after exposure to a high dose of ionizing radiation. Overall, this study establishes the ecological adaptation of a natural strain like Serratia in a uranium enriched environment and corroborates its contribution towards uranium immobilization in contaminated subsurfaces through the formation of stable uranyl phosphate minerals over a wide pH range.                          © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {The heterotrophic mineralization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) controls the CO2 flux from the inland waters to the atmosphere, especially in the boreal waters, although the mechanisms of this process and the fate of trace metals associated with DOM remain poorly understood. We studied the interaction of culturable aquatic (Pseudomonas saponiphila) and soil (Pseudomonas aureofaciens) Gammaproteobacteria with seven different organic substrates collected in subarctic settings. These included peat leachate, pine crown throughfall, fen, humic lake, stream, river, and oligotrophic lake with variable dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (from 4 to 60 mg L− 1). The highest removal of DOC over 4 days of reaction was observed in the presence of P. aureofaciens (33 ± 5%, 43 ± 3% and 53 ± 7% of the initial amount in fen water, humic lake and stream, respectively). P. saponiphila degraded only 5% of DOC in fen water but did not affect all other substrates. Trace elements (TE) were essentially controlled by short-term (0 − 1 h) adsorption on the surface of cells. Regardless of the nature of organic substrate and the identity of bacteria, the degree of adsorption ranged from 20 to 60% for iron (Fe3 +), 15 to 55% for aluminum (Al), 10 to 60% for manganese (Mn), 10 to 70% for nickel (Ni), 20 to 70% for copper (Cu), 10 to 60% for yttrium (Y), 30 to 80% for rare earth elements (REE), and 15 to 50% for uranium (UVI). Rapid adsorption of organic and organo-mineral colloids on bacterial cell surfaces is novel and potentially important process, which deserves special investigation. The long-term removal of dissolved Fe and Al was generally consistent with solution supersaturation degree with respect to Fe and Al hydroxides, calculated by visual Minteq model. Overall, the biomass-normalized biodegradability of various allochthonous substrates by culturable bacteria is much lower than that of boreal DOM by natural microbial consortia. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Aquatic macrophytes have been used extensively for the remediation of pollutants in wastewater effluents and aquatic environment over the past 30 years with the common duckweed (L. minor) as one of the most effective macrophytes that have been applied for remediation studies. Duckweed has shown strong potentials for the phytoremediation of organic pollutants, heavy metals, agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, radioactive waste, nanomaterials, petroleum hydrocarbons, dyes, toxins, and related pollutants.

The effect of biosorption factors (uptake time, pH, ionic concentration, biosorbent dosage and temperature) on U(VI) removal was determined by batch experiments. The uptake processes were characterized by using SEM, FTIR, and XPS. The experimental data of U(VI) biosorption were fitted by the pseudo-second-order. The maximum uptake capacity was 179.5 mg/g at pH 6.0 by Langmuir model.

	abstract = {Nuclear energy has been proposed as an alternative energy source in the bid to reduce carbon emissions that results from fossil fuel. Hexavalent uranium [U(VI)] is the most abandoned radioactive waste discharged from nuclear fuel processing, electricity generation power plants, radioisotope manufacturing plants. Improper disposal or storage of U(VI) containing waste may poses a threat to aquatic systems and related ecological systems. Treatment of U(VI) containing effluents from these industrial activities requires the reduction of highly mobile and radiotoxic U(VI) to tetravalent U(IV) which readily forms the hydroxide precipitate [U(OH)4(s)] under neutral pH conditions. Processes employing biofilm and fixed-film systems for treatment of wastewater are considered more robust than planktonic culture systems in the presence of high toxicity, and therefore, are preferred in the treatment of toxic liquid waste. In this study U(VI) reduction is investigated using a fixed-film reactor inoculated with U(VI) reducing bacteria isolated from tailing dump soil collected from an abandoned uranium mine in South Africa. The fixed-film bioreactor was operated as a continuous flow reactor under oxygen stressed conditions without the addition of external organic carbon source. The results from this study showed that the fixed-bed bioreactor was able to achieve >90 % U(VI) removal efficiency at U(VI) concentration of up to 85 mg/L, concentration which is higher than that observed at the study site. This demonstrates the feasibility of the fixed-bed bioreactor in continuously removing U(VI) in aqueous solutions without the need of introducing external organic carbon source and without re-seeding the bioreactor. The bioremediation technology proposed in this study significantly demonstrated the effectiveness of the biofilm processes in treating process effluent streams and U(VI) contaminated sites as part of the pump-and treat. Fundamental understanding of uranium-bacteria interactions taking place in a complex biofilm structure under such conditions would be effective in developing an appropriate radioactive waste treatment system for the subsurface bioremediation process.

	abstract = {Uranium mining and milling activities for many years resulted in release of uranium into the adjoining soil in varying degrees. Bioremediation approaches (i.e., immobilization via the action of bacteria) resulting in uranium bearing solid is supposed as an economic and clean in-situ approach for the treatment of uranium contaminated sites. This study purposes to determine the immobilization efficiency of uranium in soil by Leifsonia sp. The results demonstrated that cells have a good proliferation ability under the stress of uranium and play a role in retaining uranium in soil. Residual uranium in active Leifsonia-medium group (66%) was higher than that in the controls, which was 31% in the deionised water control, 46% in the Leifsonia group, and 47% in the medium group, respectively. This indicated that Leifsonia sp. facilitates the immobilization efficiency of uranium in soil by converting part of the reducible and oxidizable fraction of uranium into the residual fraction. X-ray photoelectron fitting results showed that tetravalent states uranium existed in the soil samples, which indicated that the hexavalent uranium was converted into tetravalent by cells. This is the first report of effect of Leifsonia sp. on uranium immobilization in soil. The findings implied that Leifsonia sp. could, to some extent, prevent the migration and diffusion of uranium in soil by changing the chemical states into less toxicity and less risky forms. © 2020},

In some cases, this activity is connected with the recovery of valuable components from the relevant natural sources, mainly the ore deposits, but in some cases the recovery is connected with the processing of some mineral wastes or even of industrial products such as metal-bearing concentrates. Since a relatively long period of time, some of these technologies have been connected with the application of different microorganisms which are able to solubilize or to precipitate the relevant metals under suitable conditions.

	abstract = {The Navajo Nation (NN), a sovereign indigenous tribal nation in the Southwestern United States, is home to 523 abandoned uranium mines (AUMs). Previous health studies have articulated numerous human health hazards associated with AUMs and multiple environmental mechanisms/pathways (e.g., air, water, and soil) for contaminant transport. Despite this evidence, the limited modeling of AUM contamination that exists relies solely on proximity to mines and only considers single rather than combined pathways from which the contamination is a product. In order to better understand the spatial dynamics of contaminant exposure across the NN, we adopted the following established geospatial and computational methods to develop a more sophisticated environmental risk map illustrating the potential for AUM contamination: GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis (GIS-MCDA), fuzzy logic, and analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Eight criteria layers were selected for the GIS-MCDA model: proximity to AUMs, roadway proximity, drainage proximity, topographic landforms, wind index, topographic wind exposure, vegetation index, and groundwater contamination. Model sensitivity was evaluated using the one-at-a-time method, and statistical validation analysis was conducted using two separate environmental datasets. The sensitivity analysis indicated consistency and reliability of the model. Model results were strongly associated with environmental uranium concentrations. The model classifies 20.2% of the NN as high potential for AUM contamination while 65.7% and 14.1% of the region are at medium and low risk, respectively. This study is entirely a novel application and a crucial first step toward informing future epidemiologic studies and ongoing remediation efforts to reduce human exposure to AUM waste. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {                             Purpose: Plant-microorganism combined bioremediation is an efficient tool to decontaminate contaminated soils, and seeking the best matching partners between plants and microorganisms that constitute the key for success in this process. The aims of the present work were to study the effects of inoculating plant growth-promoting bacterial mixtures and different mowing heights on plant development and U-uptake capacity. Materials and methods: First, a total of 12 mixtures consisting of Bacillus mucitaginosus, Bacillus subtilis, Citrobacter Werkman and Gillen, Bacillus cereus Frankland, and Bacillus thuringiensis in different proportions were analyzed for indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), siderophores, and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase produced to screen as the inocula for phytoremediation. Second, three grass species, including Lolium multiflorum Lam., Lolium perenne L., and Dactylis glomerata L., were inoculated with the best bacterial inoculant mixtures that were M                             4                              (10% Bacillus mucitaginosus, 20% Citrobacter Werkman and Gillen, 20% Bacillus thuringiensis), M                             10                              (10% Bacillus mucitaginosus, 20% Bacillus subtilis, and 10% Bacillus cereus Frankland), and M                             12                              (20% Bacillus mucitaginosus, and 10% Bacillus subtilis) selected from the first step experiment. In addition, mowing was adopted to assess the effects of mild mowing height, moderate mowing height, and heavy mowing height on U-uptake and grass growth. Results and discussion: The results demonstrated that inoculation of M                             4                              and M                             12                              significantly improved the phytoextraction capability of three grass species along with influencing plant health and plant biomass. The extraction efficiency of L. perenne to U is higher than L. multiflorum and D. glomerata in the same concentration of U-contaminated soils. Compared with the two other plants inoculated with M                             12                             , the remediation effect of L. perenne was the best. Furthermore, we observed that moderate mowing height greatly influenced the plant growth and achieved a significant biomass harvest, thereby resulting in higher U-uptake compared with other treatments. Conclusions: The present study demonstrated that inoculation of bacteria in combination with a mowing is an approach that can be exploited to improve the efficiency of phytoextraction.                          © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The development of mining and processing industries in Ukraine has increased the risk of negative impact on environment. One of the most complicated environment situations in Ukraine is the Kryvyi Rig basin, where iron ore and uranium are mined at numerous quarries. A variety of methods have been proposed for remediating water, soil and sediments. A relatively new (in Eastern Europe) in-situ method is a permeable reactive barrier (PRB) that is constructed in the subsurface to intercept and treat contaminated groundwater. One of the most promising substrate materials for PRBs is zero-valent iron which has been extensively studied in recent years. Biological treatment using PRB technology is also very promising. PRB technology employing zerovalent iron which combines subsurface fluid-flow management with contaminant treatment by biogeochemical processes are also very perspective. Batch and column experiments provided with real contaminated ground water from Zhovty Vody site show the potential for zero valent iron based remediation technologies in effective removing of uranium. Also, the provided biological experiments showed possibility for the indigenous cultures of bacteria from Zhovty Vody city to reduce U(VI) under anaerobic conditions. The results obtained proved the acceptable potential of this indigenous consortium for bioremoval of uranium from contaminated groundwater. © 2019 Monitoring 2019 Conference - Monitoring of Geological Processes and Ecological Condition of the Environment.},

	abstract = {This study compared the applicability of several geographic information systems (GIS) regression tree-based models (n = 136) to precisely define the most influencing environmental predictor parameters on arid soils. The study focused on the accumulation of arsenic, chromium, mercury, and uranium in the arid soils of Qatar using GIS tools. The rates of the built reference trees (based on environmental parameters) vary among chosen toxic metals as follows: Hg (80%), U (77%), As (72%), and Cr (70%); and this affects considerably the developed correlations (reflected as relative importance in %) between these toxic metals and the chosen environmental parameters. These parameters influence differently the investigated As/Cr/Hg/U, with higher quantitative impact (importance varying according to the metal into question) of anthropogenic parameters (distance to environmental hotspots 85–90%, land cover/use 78–82%, and proximity to roads 62–82%) than for the geopedological (soil type 30–76%, parent material 17–60%, and distance to geological structures 12–42%) and hydromorphological (elevation 7–53%, slope gradient 10–41%, distance to drainage line 15–30%, slope gradient 0–5%, and slope aspect 0–3%) parameters. The results can be used to prioritize the choice of remediation measures, and can be applied to other arid areas sharing analogous environmental/socio-economic conditions and pollution causes. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Heavy metals have emerged out as imperious category of pollutants, showing inimical effects on both human physiology and the dynamism of terrestrial and aquatic life forms and ecosystems. Depending on their oxidation states, heavy metals can be highly reactive and, therefore, toxic to the simplest to most complex organisms. Different human-based industries including metallurgical, chrome tanning, textiles, electronic, electroplating, metal culminating, fertilizer manufacture, mining, and steel and automobile industries are persuasive sources of toxic heavy metals including cadmium (Cd), gold (Au), silver (Ag), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), mercury (Hg), uranium (U), selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), and nickel (Ni). All life forms including fungi, bacteria, yeasts, plants, and animals may be affected due to toxic levels of heavy metals; however, the diversity and magnitude of toxicities may vary for different organisms. Co-occurrence of different heavy metals in an ecological community may be prime mover of significant nocuous effects of the biomass/activity and diversity of soil microbiota than those instigated by single metals at high concentrations. Remediation of heavy metal-contaminated soils is getting substantial momentum and is a perplexing task as metals cannot be degraded and the jeopardies they stance are intensified by their moxie in the environment. Microorganisms are the first entity that endures direct and indirect impacts of hazardous heavy metals. Biochemical and molecular rejoinder of soil microbial population to heavy metal-polluted environment establish a germane model for ecological studies to appraise the influence and dynamics of environmental characteristics. Several microbes have habituated and harbor potential tolerance to detoxify heavy metal-contaminated environments at cellular level different strategies through bioaccumulation, biosorption, biotransformation, etc. for ameliorating heavy metal-contaminated sites. Therefore, universally, several researchers are trapping novel microorganisms for the isolation of competent heavy metal-tolerant bacteria. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

	abstract = {Soil contaminated with heavy metals in general and radionuclides in particular represents an escalating problem for all living organisms. Since, Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident in 1986 in Ukraine, an exclusion zone of 30 km around the former power plant is uninhabitable land due to severe contamination. Two most notable beta emitters contributing to dose hazards for decades is radioactive 137Cs/90Sr. However, large parts of the zone are also highly contaminated with uranium particles (hot particles) bearing trace amounts of highly alpha-emitting radionuclides. We established an experiment at exclusion zone with the aim to investigate the influence of two macro fungi (Schizophyllum commune (S.C.) and Leucoagaricus naucinus (L.N.)) on oxidative status and antioxidative responses in winter rye plants; from this, we wanted to test the radionuclide/heavy metals retention capacity of both fungi, and probe their further potential for mycoremediation. Result shows some differences in the concentrations of radionuclides/heavy metals and micro/macronutrients uptake in plants. As a biomarker of oxidative status, lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels and other antioxidative parameters were determined, i.e., superoxide-dismutase (SOD) isoenzymes, cysteine (CYS), and ascorbic acid (AA) concentrations as well as catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities in winter rye shoots. LPO showed no significant differences between controls and plants cultivated with macro fungi. However, CAT activities were elevated in the presence of S.C/L.N compared with control, while GR activity was significantly higher only in presence of S.C. In contrast, isozyme of SOD (Cu,Zn-SOD) was the most prominent in control. Likewise, CYS content was lower in plants grown with both fungi, while AA concentration was only lower in the presence of L.N. The results showed that presence of fungi in radionuclide contaminated soil caused induction of antioxidative response in shoots of winter rye and that the response depended on the type of fungi used. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The uranium accumulators including Helianthus annuus, Macleaya cordata and Salicaceae were planted in monoculture and intercropping patterns to remediate uranium contaminated soils. The bioaccumulation capabilities of the plants for uranium, and the microbial communities, the organic acid contents and the transformation of uranium species in their rhizosphere soils were investigated. It is found that compared with the monoculture pattern, the bioaccumulation amounts of uranium by Macleaya cordata and Salicaceae in the intercropping pattern increase by 183.50% and 24.93%, respectively, and their translocation factors increase by 120.31% and 104.3%, respectively, showing that the phytoremediation of uranium by Macleaya cordata and Salicaceae in intercropping pattern has the highest efficiency, and the proportions of tolerant bacteria Acidobacteria, growth-promoting bacteria Bradyrhizobium and excreting organic acids bacteria Aspergillus significantly increase, and the contents of oxalic acid and malonic acid also obviously increase. Macleaya cordata and Salicaceae in intercropping pattern could remediate uranium contaminated soils more efficiently than in monoculture pattern, the main mechanism may be that the Acidobacteria and Bradyrhizobium improve their tolerance and bioaccumulation abilities for uranium, and the organic acids excreted by Aspergillus could chelate with uranium, resulting in the increase of the proportion of uranium in exchangeable fraction. © 2018, Editorial Board of Atomic Energy Science and Technology.

	abstract = {This study evaluated uranium sequestration performance in iron-rich (30 g/kg) sediment via bioreduction followed by reoxidation. Field tests (1383 days) at Oak Ridge, Tennessee demonstrated that uranium contents in sediments increased after bioreduced sediments were re-exposed to nitrate and oxygen in contaminated groundwater. Bioreduction of contaminated sediments (1200 mg/kg U) with ethanol in microcosm reduced aqueous U from 0.37 to 0.023 mg/L. Aliquots of the bioreduced sediment were reoxidized with O2, H2O2, and NaNO3, respectively, over 285 days, resulting in aqueous U of 0.024, 1.58 and 14.4 mg/L at pH 6.30, 6.63 and 7.62, respectively. The source- and the three reoxidized sediments showed different desorption and adsorption behaviors of U, but all fit a Freundlich model. The adsorption capacities increased sharply at pH 4.5 to 5.5, plateaued at pH 5.5 to 7.0, then decreased sharply as pH increased from 7.0 to 8.0. The O2-reoxidized sediment retained a lower desorption efficiency at pH over 6.0. The NO3 −-reoxidized sediment exhibited higher adsorption capacity at pH 5.5 to 6.0. The pH-dependent adsorption onto Fe(III) oxides and formation of U coated particles and precipitates resulted in U sequestration, and bioreduction followed by reoxidation can enhance the U sequestration in sediment. © 2019},

The optimum concentrations of IAA, GA3, 6-BA, and EBL were determined based on plant biomass production, metal uptake, translocation, and removal efficiency. The biomass and total chlorophyll content decreased under Cd and U stress. Nevertheless, the application of IAA, GA3, and 6-BA significantly (p < 0.05) increased the growth and total chlorophyll content of mustard. The malondialdehyde (MDA) and H2O2 content of mustard were enhanced under Cd and U stress, but they were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in plant growth regulators (PGRs) treatments (except for EBL). PGRs treatments increased activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase, thus reducing the oxidative stress. Furthermore, the shoot uptake of Cd and U of IAA and EBL treatments was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than that of other treatments. IAA and EBL also have more significant effects on the translocation and remediation of Cd and U compared to GA3 and 6-BA. The removal efficiency of Cd and U reached the maximum in the 500 mg L−1 IAA treatment, which was 330.77% and 118.61% greater than that in the control (CK), respectively. These results suggested that PGRs could improve the stress tolerance and efficiency of phytoremediation using B. juncea in Cd- and U- contaminated soils. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {At the Department of Energy (DOE) managed Savannah River Site (SRS), uranium and other heavy metals continue to pose threats to the ecosystem health and processes. In the oxic soil of this site, uranium is present primarily as soluble salts of the uranyl ion (i.e., U(VI) or UO22+). Although UO22+ has a strong sorption to the soil, the mobile indigenous bacteria may facilitate its transport. On the contrary, precipitation of UO22+ with phosphate has been found to be an alternative remediation strategy. This research investigated the effects of mobile bacteria and phytate on UO22+ transport at SRS in column experiments. It was discovered that UO22+ can barely be mobilized by de-ionized water but can be significantly transported with the aid of mobile indigenous bacteria. UO22+ had the most facilitated transport observation when it reached equilibrium with the bacteria before the transport. When UO22+ and bacterial were introduced to the soil at the same time or UO22+ was pre-deposited in the soil, the facilitated transport was less pronounced. In the presence of phytate, bacterial-facilitated UO22+ transport was hindered. pH was found to play the key role for UO22+ immobilization in the presence of phytate. The immobilization of UO22+ with the addition of phytate increased with the increase of pH within the pH range of this study because of the impact of pH on the solubility of UO2(OH)2. Phytate promoted UO2--PO43- complex and/or [Ca(UO2)2(PO4)2] formation, leading to enhanced UO22+ immobilization in the SRS soil. © 2019},

	abstract = {In this paper, we systematically investigated the influence of some selected ligands on the U-phosphate precipitation induced by soil bacteria. These organics are widely ranging from acetate, lactate, salicylate and citrate to oxalate. The results revealed that uranium could be biomineralized on bacteria as UO2HPO4·4H2O or (UO2)3(PO4)2·4H2O. The influence of organic ligands on the biomineralization had clear-cut correlations with its complexation abilities to uranyl. It was clearly found that the U-phosphate biomineralization was affected noticeably by the strong ligands (oxalate and citrate). Further study discovered that when the organic ligands were uncompetitive with biotic PO4 3− for uranyl, the transformation of uranyl species from β-UO2(OH)2 colloidal particles to free UO2 2+-ligands ions could facilitate the U-phosphate biomineralization. However, when the organic ligands competed with biotic PO4 3− for uranyl, the U-phosphate biomineralization were inhibited. Our results highlight the importance of complex interactions of strong organic ligands with uranyl during the bacterial precipitation of U–P compounds and thus for the mobilization and immobilization of radio-nuclides in the nature. © 2019},

The present study investigated the enrichment characteristics of U and other heavy metals (As, Cu, Pb, Mn, Mo, Zn, Cd, Co, and Ni) in the soil–plant system in Xiazhuang uranium mine. Four dominant plants (Castanopsis carlesii, Rhus chinensis, Liriodendron chinense, and Sapium discolor) and soil samples were collected from the mined areas, unmined areas, and background areas away from the ore field. U, As, Cu, Pb, Mn, Mo, Zn, Cd, Co, and Ni concentrations were analyzed by ICP-MS. The results demonstrate that (1) The highest concentrations of U (4.1–206.9 mg/kg) and Pb (43.3–126.0 mg/kg) with the geoaccumulation index (Igeo) greater than 1 show that they are the main soil pollutants in the research area. (2) The biological accumulation coefficient (LBAC) values for Cd, Mn, and Cu are greater than zero in S. discolor, L. chinense, and C. carlesii and these three plants indicate that they can be used for remediation of the soil in the ore field. (3) R. chinensis inhibits the accumulation of heavy metals and shows sensitive pigment responses to the accumulation of U in the leaves. L. chinense has the strongest enrichment effect on heavy metals but exhibits weak biochemical responses under U stress. C. carlesii demonstrates strong adaptation to U and can maintain healthy pigment characteristics in case of high U enrichment. (4) S. discolor, L. chinense, C. carlesii and R. chinensis have strong tolerance to U toxicity and different biochemical responses. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {To investigate the heavy metal and metalloid contamination of soil around a Huanan uranium tailings pond, abandoned in 1998, we defined a study area of 41.25 km2 by a natural boundary and targeted 5 elements’ (U, Mn, As, Pb, Cr) single contamination and comprehensive pollution as the assessment contents. First, we collected 205 samples and evaluated them with the contamination factor (CF) method aiming at judging whether the single target element concentration exceeded the local background value and environmental quality standard. We obtained CF1 (the background value of a certain target element as the baseline value) and CF2 (the environmental quality standard for soils as the baseline value). Second, we evaluated the ecological risk of the key pollutant U with the risk assessment code (RAC) method, taking the 27 samples whose CF2 > 1 as examples and concluded that the environmental risk of U was relatively high and should arouse concern. Third, we selected comprehensive pollution index (CPI) to assess the compound pollution degree of five target elements. Fourth, we constructed the U contamination and CPI’s continuous distribution maps with spatial interpolation, from which we worked out the sizes and positions of slightly, moderately and strongly polluted zones. Finally, we analyzed the spatial variability of U and CPI with the aid of a geostatistical variogram. We deduced that the spatial variation of uranium was in close relationship with local topography, and probably precipitation was the driving force of U contamination diffusion, whereas CPI exhibited weak spatial dependence with random characteristics. The above work showed that 3.14 km2 soil near the pond was fairly seriously polluted, and the other 4 elements’ single contaminations were less serious, but the 5 target elements’ cumulative pollution could not be ignored; there were other potential pollution sources besides the uranium tailings pond. Some emergency measures should be taken to treat U pollution, and bioremediation is recommended, taking account into U’s high bioavailability. Further, special alerts should be implemented to identify the other pollution sources. © 2018, MDPI AG. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this atomic age, exposure to toxins in the environment ranges from radioactive heavy metals to chemical pesticides, and detoxification has become an issue of considerable importance. Recently, many parts of the world have been contaminated with radioactive waste from depleted uranium bombs and projectiles including the Arabian Gulf, Iraq, Syria, Bosnia, Serbia, and Afghanistan. In addition, other areas of the globe have been contaminated by nuclear testing sites and accidents at nuclear power plants involving radioactive uranium and its decay products. There are three naturally occurring uranium isotopes that are of major significance with regard to mining of this element and the nuclear industry. These include uranium-238 (U-238), which comprises the majority of this element in the Earth’s crust, uranium-235 (U-235), and uranium-234 (U-234), which together comprise a much smaller portion. The half-lives of these isotopes are approximately 4500 million years, 703 million years, and 246, 000 years, respectively. The transfer of radionuclides of the uranium decay series through the environment is important for assessing the impact of nuclear weapons use, nuclear power plant leaks, and the mining and milling of uranium ores. The pathway from soil through plants to humans contributes significantly to the overall radiation dose. The transfer of mobilized radionuclides within the environment is determined by weathering rate, which, in turn, depends on particle composition and chemical conditions such as pH of the soil after deposition. Specific geographical sites that have been contaminated with uranium attract specific bacterial species that display resistance to the metal. Moreover, various plant species exhibit substantial differences in the soil-plant transfer factor for uranium and other related radionuclides. The biological effects of environmental radionuclides in humans (particularly depleted uranium) have been documented as part of the Gulf War syndrome and Balkan syndrome and comprise a complex set of seemingly unrelated symptoms. Some of these include incapacitating fatigue, musculoskeletal and joint pains, headaches, neuropsychiatric disorders, confusion, visual problems, changes of gait, loss of memory, lymphadenopathies, respiratory impairment, impotence, and urinary tract morphological and functional alterations. Moreover, the overall incidence of breast and lung cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma has doubled or tripled in certain areas of Iraq contaminated with depleted uranium during the Gulf War. An association with lung cancer has also been found in uranium miners. Thus, soil remediation, plant selection, phytoremediation, and human detoxification are the main issues to be considered in relation to environmental contamination with uranium and its decay products. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

We assessed the bacterial community from low (2–20 mg kg−1), medium (200–400 mg kg−1), high (500–900 mg kg−1) and very high (>900 mg kg−1) uranium soils at Ranger Uranium Mine in northern Australia through pyrosequencing. Proteobacteria (28.85%) was the most abundant phylum at these sites, followed by Actinobacteria (9.31%), Acidobacteria (7.33%), Verrucomicrobia (2.11%), Firmicutes (2.02%), Chloroflexi (1.11%), Cyanobacteria (0.93%), Planctomycetes (0.82%), Bacteroidetes (0.46%) and Candidate_division_WS3 (Latescibacteria) (0.21%). However, 46.79% of bacteria were unclassified. Bacteria at low U soils differed from soils with elevated uranium. Bacterial OTUs closely related to Kitasatospora spp., Sphingobacteria spp. and Rhodobium spp. were only present at higher uranium concentrations and the bacterial community also changed with seasonal and temporal changes in soil uranium and physicochemical variables. This study using next generation sequencing in association with environmental variables at a uranium mine has laid a foundation for further studies of soil-microbe-metal interactions which may be useful for developing sustainable management and rehabilitation strategies.

	abstract = {With the development of nuclear power, radioactive pollutants discharge into the environment and then contaminate soil and water resources. Nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) materials are widely used in water remediation due to their strong reducibility and high removal efficiency. A carbon-based zero-valent iron material (Fe-CB) was prepared in this work. Fe-CB was fabricated using sodium alginate (SA) as a carbon source via one-step carbothermic method and then applied to eliminate U(VI) from aqueous solution. Its mechanism and adsorption properties of Fe-CB and U(VI) were studied by spectroscopic analyses and macroscopic experiments. The results illustrated that Fe-CB possessed of ample functional groups (such as -OH and -COOH) and high BET surface area, which made up for the dispersibility and low removal efficiency of nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI). The removal of U(VI) by Fe-CB achieved equilibrium in 3 h and the maximum sorption capacity was 77.3 mg•g-1 at 298 K. XPS analyses indicated that the U(VI) removal by Fe-CB was a synergistic effect of reductive adsorptive processes. Adsorption process resulted from surface complexation and the reduction process was dominated by U(VI) reduction to U(IV) by nZVI. The results show that Fe-CB can be used as an inexpensive and highly efficient pollutant scavenger, which has great potential for environment pollution management. © 2020, Science Press.

	abstract = {This study investigated the effect of ethylenediamine-N,N′-disuccinic acid (EDDS), oxalic acid (OA), and citric acid (CA) on phytoextraction of U- and Cd-contaminated soil by Z. pendula. In this study, the biomass of tested plant inhibited significantly following treatment with the high concentration (7.5 mmol·kg−1) EDDS treatment. Maximum U and Cd concentration in the single plant was observed with the 5 mmol·kg−1 CA and 7.5 mmol·kg−1 EDDS treatment, respectively, whereas OA treatments had the lowest U and Cd uptake. The translocation factors of U and Cd reached the maximum in the 5 mmol·kg−1 EDDS. The maximum bioaccumulation of U and Cd in the single plants was 1032.14 µg and 816.87 µg following treatment with 5 mmol·kg−1 CA treatment, which was 6.60- and 1.72-fold of the control groups, respectively. Furthermore, the resultant rank order for available U and Cd content in the soil was CA > EDDS > OA (U) and EDDS > CA > OA (Cd). These results suggested that CA could greater improve the capacity of phytoextraction using Z. pendula in U- and Cd- contaminated soils. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Two Bacillus atrophaeus strains, the first being a highly stress-resistant ATCC 9372 strain and the Ua strain identified from a chromium mine by our lab, differ in their abilities to tolerate and remove Uranium (VI) from contaminated water. An increase in U(VI) concentration in growth media led to a decrease in the tolerance and bio-remedial capacity of both strains. However, under high concentrations of U(VI) in the growth media, the ATCC 9372 strain demonstrated a higher tolerance and a higher removal capacity than the Ua strain. Two approaches, transcriptome sequencing and transgenic technology, were used to elucidate the relationship between particular genes within these two strains and their U(VI) removal capacity. Sequencing confirmed the expression of two genes unique to the Ua strain, previously designated ytiB and ythA. They encode putative proteins that show the highest levels of identity to carbonic anhydrase and cytochrome bd terminal oxidase I, respectively. Using the pBE-S DNA vector, ytiB and ythA were transformed into the ATCC 9372 strain of Bacillus atrophaeus. Under a U(VI) concentration of 120 mg/L, the removal rates of the transgenic ATCC 9372-ytiB and ATCC 9372-ythA strains decreased by 7.55% and 7.43%, respectively, compared to the removal rate of the control strain transformed with empty plasmid. The results suggest that both ythA and ytiB genes have a negative influence on the uranium removing capacity of Bacillus atrophaeus. This finding will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of uranium removal by bacteria. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The results showed that the mean concentrations of Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, As, Hg, Cr, Mn, Ni, U, and232Th were 2 275.69, 6.09, 71.51, 1 230.47, 47.87, 502.81, 46.22, 422.39, 12.01, 74.05 and 27.28 mg•kg-1, respectively. The concentrations of Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, As, Hg and U were higher than the soil environmental background values in study area. The original mine stope and original mineral ore stockyard were the a key polluted areas. The geo-accumulation index (Igeo) showed that Hg in farmland was in strongly polluted level, and Cd, Zn, Pb and U were higher than moderately polluted level. Covering soil, passivation and phytoremediation were applied to remedy the polluted sites. Soils should be covered in the original mine site firstly and then the passivator was added or the phytoextraction was conducted. The result showed that radon exhalation rate was below or equal to 0.74 Bq•(m2•s)-1, and gamma-ray dose rate was close to 30×10-8Gy•h-1 in the original mine stope and original mineral ore stockyard after covering with soils of 140 cm, 120 cm, which was in accordance with environmental standards. © 2018, Science Press.

	abstract = {The Osamu Utsumi uranium mine occupies a 20 km2 area in the city of Caldas, which is located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Since mining activities ended at Osamu Utsumi 24 years ago, the surrounding area has become contaminated by acid effluents containing high concentrations of uranium. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the uranium bioremediation capacity of 57 fungi isolated from the mine area. In tolerance tests, 38% (22) of the fungal isolates were considered tolerant to uranium, including 10 Penicillium species. At a uranium concentration of 2000 mg L−1 48 fungi did not exhibit mycelial growth index inhibition. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) analysis showed growth of 25 fungi above a uranium concentration of 8000 mg L−1. At high uranium concentrations, some fungi (i.e., Talaromyces amestolkiae and Penicillium citrinum) showed morphological changes and pigment (melanin) production. Among the fungal isolates, those considered to be more tolerant to uranium were isolated from soil and sediment samples containing higher concentrations of heavy metal. When comparing the results of resistance/tolerance tests with those for uranium biosorption capacity, we concluded that the fungi isolated from the Osamu Utsumi mine with the best potential for uranium bioremediation were Gongronella butleri, Penicillium piscarium, Penicillium citrinum, Penicillium ludwigii, and Talaromyces amestolkiae. Biosorption tests with live fungal biomass showed that 11 species had a high potential for uranium uptake from contaminated water. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In this study, three different electrode materials (graphite, stainless steel, and titanium rods) were used to explore the electro kinetic (EK) remediation of soil contaminated with uranium (U). All EK experiments were carried out in a soil cell reactor with a moisture content of 25.1% and a total uranium mixture of 90.6 mg/kg at a constant voltage gradient (1V/cm) for 5 days. The experimental results show that the EK repair process with graphite rod as the electrode material has the highest current peak, and the overall current level is higher than the other two electrode materials. Compared with stainless steel and titanium rods, the removal efficiency of using graphite as the electrode material U in contaminated soil reached 34.11%. However, the removal rates using stainless steel and titanium rods were lower, 15.79% and 18.77%, respectively. In the EK experiment, the main removal is from the exchangeable part of U to the carbon-bound U composition, while the remaining forms of uranium are difficult to remove under this condition, so in order to be more efficient, the uranium in the soil is removed with maximum reduction. It is necessary to use it in conjunction with other enhancement technologies. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The bioaccumulation amount of uranium by each plant in the Bamboo-willow (Salix sp.)-Paspalum scrobiculatum linn-Macleaya cordata community plot was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that by its single population, the bioaccumulation amounts of uranium by Bamboo-willow (Salix sp.), Paspalum scrobiculatum linn and Macleaya cordata were 0.29, 0.32 and 2.19 mg/plant, respectively, and they were increased by 31.82%, 77.78% and 146.07%, respectively, and the transfer efficiencies by the plants were increased by 150%, 110% and 52.17%, respectively. The interaction between the plants' roots and the microorganisms in the rhizosphere soil of the Bamboo-willow (Salix sp.)-Paspalum scrobiculatum linn-Macleaya cordata community plot resulted in the high content of organic acids such as oxalic acid in the rhizosphere soil of the plant community plot, which was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that of its single population. The chelation of the organic acids with uranium led to an increase in the proportion of exchangeable uranium in soil solution. In addition, Burkholderia, which is an iron-producing carrier bacterium and can increase the uptake and accumulation of uranium by plants, and Leptolyngbya, which is a plant growth promoting rhizobacteria and can increase the biomass of plants, emerged in the rhizosphere soil of the plant community plot. These may be the mechanisms by which the phytoremediation of the uranium contaminated soils was enhanced by the plant community plot. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The ex situ decontamination of uranium polluted soils was performed by alkaline washing using mechanical agitation and ultrasound field. Two types of polluted soils were considered in terms of texture and organic content. The tests were performed using experimental design: a 23 factorial plan for mechanical washing and Taguchi L18 orthogonal matrix for ultrasound (US)-assisted decontamination. The factors considered in mechanical washing were temperature, duration, and pH. For ultrasound decontamination, the US frequency was added. The optimum was estimated based on statistical analysis and validated by confirmation experiments. The study revealed that in ultrasound field, the decontamination degree is increased with over 25% compared with mechanical stirring, while the duration of the process is drastically reduced (from 120 to 25 min). The most important factor leading to the increase of decontamination is the ultrasound frequency. To refine the result, artificial neural network modeling and subsequent optimization by genetic algorithms were also carried out for the decontamination in ultrasound field, and new optimum operating conditions were identified and validated. The best operating conditions identified were temperature around 50 °C, pH = 8, and ultrasound frequency of 24 kHz. In these conditions, the decontamination degree reached 85% for Soil 1 (characterized by low clay and organic content) and 69% for Soil 2 (with high clay and organic content). © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Uranium (U) accumulation in organic soils is a common phenomenon that can lead to high U concentration in montane wetlands. The stability of the immobilized U in natural wetlands following redox fluctuations and re-oxidation events, however, is not currently known. In this study, we investigated a saturated histosol that had accumulated up to 6000 ppm of U at 30 cm below ground level (bgl). Uranium in the waters feeding the wetland originates from the weathering of surrounding gneiss rocks, a process releasing trace amounts (<3 ppb) of soluble U into nearby streams. Redox oscillations in the first 20 cm bgl led to the accumulation of U, Ca, S in low permeability layers at 30 and 45 cm bgl. XRF measurements along the core showed that U strongly correlates with sulfur (S) and calcium (Ca), but not iron (Fe). We tested the stability of uranium in the histosol over a nine-month laboratory amendment of a large core of the histosol (∅ 30 cm; length 55 cm) with up to 500 ppm nitrate. Nitrate addition was followed by complete nitrate reduction and re-generation of oxidizing Eh conditions in the top 25 cm of the soil without U release to the soil pore waters above background levels (1–2 ppb). Our results demonstrate that, fast reduction of nitrate, sulfate, and Fe(III) occur in the soil without U release. The remarkable stability of sorbed U in the histosol may result from buffering by sulfide and Sn° and/or strong U(IV)-OM or U(VI)-OM enhanced by organic S moieties or bridging complexation by Ca. That U in the soil was immobile under nitrate addition for up to 9 months can inform remediation strategies based on the use of artificial wetlands to limit U mobility in contaminated sites. © 2020 The Authors},

Metals and radionuclides are likely to occur in the mobile phase or may bind to soil particles and geologic framework. The transport process for reactive contaminants also include chemical reactions in groundwater aquifers, which are complex physical and biogeochemical processes. Accurate tools to reliably predict the movement and changes in concentration of metals and their daughter products (radionuclides) formations in the subsurface environment is important for decision makers to analyze impact, and to evaluate the effectiveness of remediation strategies. An advanced numerical model can provide such useful direction of predictions. A 3-D contaminant transport model for fluid flow, hydrogeologic transport, and biogeochemical kinetic and equilibrium reactions in saturated and unsaturated media was calibrated, validated and implemented to model the hydrogeochemical processes that occur in the subsurface at such a complex contaminated site, consisting of waste rock dumps and flooded mine pits of this abandoned uranium mine site.

	abstract = {the groundwater and soil reservoirs of the planet on a large scale. Due to high economic and ecologic demands of the current methods to treat such wastes, there is much interest in cost effective, fast and environmentally sustainable technologies for radionuclide treatment. One of such methods employs use of conjugate magnetic particles, which not only decontaminate the wastewater but also yield back actinides to be reused. It has been observed that chelators used in the conjugate MNPs show different stability under different conditions so, this technique faces challenges in wide range of application. Another ecological responsible approach is the use of microbes to reduce radioactive load in diverse environments. This chapter analyses the diverse microbial populations and considers various forms of microbial remediation including bio stimulation, biosorption, enzymatic reduction and non-enzymatic enzymatic reduction of radionuclides. Recombinant strains of Deinococcus radiodurans, Escherichia coli and Kineococcus radiotolerans proved to be radiation-resistant and beneficial in bioremediation of uranium, mercury, chromium and technetium. Various factors including temperature, PH, natural microflora at site and soil porosity, limit the process of microbial remediation depending upon the site at which the process is being carried out. This chapter will help to understand overall analysis of the remediation techniques that are necessary to be employed for safe environment. © 2020 Scrivener Publishing LLC.},

	abstract = {During the operation and the decommissioning of a nuclear site the operator must assure the protection of the workers and the environment. It must furthermore identify and classify the various wastes, while optimizing the associated costs. At all stages of the decommissioning radiological measurements are performed to determine the initial situation, to monitor the demolition and clean-up, and to verify the final situation. Radiochemical analysis is crucial for the radiological evaluation process to optimize the clean-up operations and to the respect limits defined with the authorities. Even though these types of analysis are omnipresent in activities such as the exploitation, the monitoring, and the cleaning up of nuclear plants, some nuclear sites do not have their own radiochemical analysis laboratory. Mobile facilities can overcome this lack when nuclear facilities are dismantled, when contaminated sites are cleaned-up, or in a post-accident situation. The current operations for the characterization of radiological soils of CEA nuclear facilities, lead to a large increase of radiochemical analysis. To manage this high throughput of samples in a timely manner, the CEA has developed a new mobile laboratory for the clean-up of its soils, called SMaRT (Shelter for Monitoring and nucleAR chemisTry). This laboratory is dedicated to the preparation and the radiochemical analysis (alpha, beta, and gamma) of potentially contaminated samples. In this framework, CEA and Eichrom laboratories has signed a partnership agreement to extend the analytical capacities and bring on site optimized and validated methods for different problematic. Gamma-emitting radionuclides can usually be measured in situ as little or no sample preparation is required. Alpha and beta-emitting radionuclides are a different matter. Analytical chemistry laboratory facilities are required. Mobile and transportable laboratories equipped with the necessary tools can provide all that is needed. The main advantage of a mobile laboratory is its portability; the shelter can be placed in the vicinity of nuclear facilities under decommissioning, or of contaminated sites with infrastructures unsuitable for the reception and treatment of radioactive samples. Radiological analysis can then be performed without the disadvantages of radioactive material transport. This paper describes how this solution allows a fast response and control of costs, with a high analytical capacity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The Alto da Várzea radium mine (AV) exploited ore and U-bearing minerals, such as autunite and torbernite. The mine was exploited underground from 1911 to 1922, closed in 1946 without restoration, and actually a commercial area is deployed. Stream sediments, soils and water samples were collected between 2008 and 2009. Stream sediments are mainly contaminated in As, Th, U and W, which is related to the AV radium mine. The PTEs, As, Co, Cr, Sr, Th, U, W, Zn, and electrical conductivity reached the highest values in soils collected inside the mine influence. Soils are contaminated with As and U and must not be used for any purpose. Most waters have pH values ranging from 4.3 to 6.8 and are poorly mineralized (EC = 41–186 µS/cm; TDS = 33–172 mg/L). Groundwater contains the highest Cu, Cr and Pb contents. Arsenic occurs predominantly as H2(AsO4)− and H(AsO4)2−. Waters are saturated in goethite, haematite and some of them also in lepidocrocite and ferrihydrite, which adsorbs As (V). Lead is divalent in waters collected during the warm season, being mobile in these waters. Thorium occurs mainly as Th(OH)3(CO3)−, Th(OH)2(CO3) and Th(OH)2(CO3)2         2−, which increase water Th contents. Uranium occurs predominantly as UO2CO3, but CaUO2(CO3)3         2− and CaUO2(CO3)3 also occur, decreasing its mobility in water. The waters are contaminated in NO2         −, Mn, Cu, As, Pb and U and must not be used for human consumption and in agricultural activities. The water contamination is mainly associated with the old radium mine and human activities. A restoration of the mining area with PTE monitoring is necessary to avoid a public hazard. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

TW18 can be satisfactorily fitted by pseudo-second-order model. The accumulation of U(VI) on Pantoea sp. TW18 was affected by pH levels, not independent of ionic strength. Analysis of the FT-IR and XPS spectra demonstrated that accumulated U(VI) ions were primarily bound to nitrogen- and oxygen-containing functional groups (i.e., carboxyl, amide and phosphoryl groups) on the Pantoea sp. TW18 surface. This study showed that Pantoea sp. TW18 can be considered as a promising sorbent for remediation of radionuclides in environmental cleanup. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Heavy metal pollution by both uranium and arsenic has become a major environmental problem associated with uranium mining worldwide. At present, physical, chemical and biological technologies are available as the main remediation techniques. Among them, phytoremediation is relatively low cost, hinders more pollution and allows for fast recycling of the uranium as compared to other techniques. However, suitable phytoremediation depends critically on the better choice of plant species. In this study, field sampling of soils and plants surrounding a uranium mine was conducted, and atomic emission spectrometry of samples performed, in order to characterize the distribution of heavy metal pollution and to provide a scientific basis for the phytoremediation of uranium mining sites. Soil uranium concentrations were found to be highest in open-pit mine sites, followed by ore dressing investigation sites and also the river confluence sites. Uranium did not migrate from active mining areas and the highest uranium concentration measured 232.70 mg×kg-1. In contrast, arsenic regularly migrated downstream, with soil concentrations averaging 47.26 mg×kg-1, two times the limit set by the Three Grade Standard of Soil Quality in China (GB 15618-1995). Rumex nepalensis accumulated high levels of uranium, with a bioconcentration factor of 3.60 and a transfer factor of 3.61. Polygonum viviparum was able to accumulate arsenic, with a root transfer factor of 3.69, and also uranium as indicated by a bioconcentration factor greater than one. Thus, our investigations improved the understanding of the potential role of Polygonum viviparum and Rumex nepalensis involved in phytoremediation of uranium or uranium-arsenic pollution. © 2020, HARD Publishing Company.

	abstract = {Hydrothermal carbon adsorption materials possess the advantages of simple preparation process, mild synthesis conditions and easy surface modification. In this UO2 2+ speciation as a function of CO3 2- concentration, soluble starch used as carbon source, acrylonitrile was grafted onto starch molecule through ring opening under the catalysis of cerium ammonium nitrate. Subsequently, amidoxime hydrothermal carbon spheres (AO-HTC) were successfully synthesized by hydrothermal reaction and hydroxylamine hydrochloride reduction. Meanwhile, static and dynamic adsorption experiments were performed to investigate the effects of solution pH, carbonate and calcium ion concentration on the adsorption performance of AO-HTC for uranium. And the dynamic adsorption process of AO-HTC for uranium was also studied by Yoon-Nelson and Thomas models. The results show that the adsorption capacity of AO-HTC, the volume of penetration point as well as saturation point in the penetration curve also decreases gradually with the increase of pH, carbonate concentration and calcium concentration. The maximum adsorption capacity (qo) and the required time (τ) of adsorbate through 50% of 5% AO-HTC column are several times higher than that of pure soil column. Therefore, the research highlights that AO-HTC would act as an excellent permeable-reactive barriers (PRB) medium and expected to remediate uranium-contaminated soil and groundwater. © 2020, Science Press.

	abstract = {Purpose: The remediation of uranium (U)-contaminated soil has become one of the most challenging problems in the field of environmental protection. U immobilization in soil via bacteria is supposed as a promising approach. This study seeks to determine the bioavailability of U and the potential mechanism under the experiment of Leifsonia sp. by pot experiment. Materials and methods: Each pot was filled with sterilized soil of the same concentration of U (200 mg/kg) and the same amount of water (500 ml) to simulate the wetland environment around the uranium tailings. Four treatments were performed on different pots (control group, add Leifsonia sp. group, add plants group, and add both plants and Leifsonia sp. group), via comparing the content changes of U in soil, water and plants in each pot during the experimental period to study the influence of Leifsonia sp. on the transfer of U. In addition, MINEQL and sequential extraction procedures were used to calculate and analyze the various forms of U. In order to further explore the mechanism of Leifsonia sp. affecting the bioavailability of U, modern detection technologies (SEM-EDS, FTIR, and XPS) were used to test soil samples. Results and discussion: The results showed that bioconcentration factor (BCF), bioaccumulation factor (BAF), and transfer factor (TF) of U in Leifsonia sp. experimental groups were lower than those in the control groups. Moreover, the residual U (46.46%) in pots with Leifsonia sp. was higher than that of the control pots (6.72%). This indicates that Leifsonia sp. may facilitate the immobilization efficiency of U in soil by converting part of reducible and oxidizable fraction of uranium into residual fraction. SEM-EDS showed that the peak of U appeared on the surface of Leifsonia sp. after the pot experiment. A possible explanation for this, supported by FTIR, is that –OH, –NH, and –C=O on the cell surface were involved in the process. XPS measurements indicate that part of U(VI) was transformed into U(IV). Conclusions: These findings imply that Leifsonia sp. can, to some extent, prevent the bioavailability of U in soil by changing the chemical states into less toxicity and less risky forms. The results have guiding significance for the site application of Leifsonia sp. in soil. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Arthrobacter sp. strain SRS-W-1-2016 was isolated on high concentrations of uranium (U) from the Savannah River Site (SRS) that remains co-contaminated by radionuclides, heavy metals, and organics. SRS is located on the northeast bank of the Savannah River (South Carolina, USA), which is a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) managed ecosystem left historically contaminated from decades of nuclear weapons production activities. Predominant contaminants within the impacted SRS environment include U and Nickel (Ni), both of which can be transformed microbially into less toxic forms via metal complexation mechanisms. Strain SRS-W-1-2016 was isolated from the uraniferous SRS soils on high concentrations of U (4200 μM) and Ni (8500 μM), but rapid growth was observed at much lower concentrations of 500 μMU and 1000 μMNi, respectively. Microcosm studies established with strain SRS-W-1-2016 revealed a rapid decline in the concentration of spiked U such that it was almost undetectable in the supernatant by 72 h of incubation. Conversely, Ni concentrations remained unchanged, suggesting that the strain removed U but not Ni under the tested conditions. To obtain a deeper understanding of the metabolic potential, a draft genome sequence of strain SRS-W-1-2016 was obtained at a coverage of 90×, assembling into 93 contigs with an N50 contig length of 92,788 bases. The genomic size of strain SRS-W-1-2016 was found to be 4,564,701 bases with a total number of 4327 putative genes. An in-depth, genome-wide comparison between strain SRS-W-1-2016 and its four closest taxonomic relatives revealed 1159 distinct genes, representing 26.7% of its total genome; many associating with metal resistance proteins (e.g., for cadmium, cobalt, and zinc), transporter proteins, stress proteins, cytochromes, and drug resistance functions. Additionally, several gene homologues coding for resistance to metals were identified in the strain, such as outer membrane efflux pump proteins, peptide/nickel transport substrate and ATP-binding proteins, a high-affinity nickel-transport protein, and the spoT gene, which was recently implicated in bacterial resistance towards U. Detailed genome mining analysis of strain SRS-W-1-2016 also revealed the presence of a plethora of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters likely facilitating resistance to antibiotics, biocides, and metals. Additionally, several gene homologous for the well-known oxygenase enzyme system were also identified, potentially functioning to generate energy via the breakdown of organic compounds and thus enabling the successful colonization and natural attenuation of contaminants by Arthrobacter sp.

	abstract = {The family Geobacteraceae, with its only valid genus Geobacter, comprises deltaproteobacteria ubiquitous in soil, sediments, and subsurface environments where metal reduction is an active process. Research for almost three decades has provided novel insights into environmental processes and biogeochemical reactions not previously known to be carried out by microorganisms. At the heart of the environmental roles played by Geobacter bacteria is their ability to integrate redox pathways and regulatory checkpoints that maximize growth efficiency with electron donors derived from the decomposition of organic matter while respiring metal oxides, particularly the often abundant oxides of ferric iron. This metabolic specialization is complemented by versatile metabolic reactions, respiratory chains, and sensory networks that allow specific members to adaptively respond to environmental cues to integrate organic and inorganic contaminants in their oxidative and reductive metabolism, respectively. Thus, Geobacteraceae are important members of the microbial communities that degrade hydrocarbon contaminants under iron-reducing conditions and that contribute, directly or indirectly, to the reduction of radionuclides, toxic metals, and oxidized species of nitrogen. Their ability to produce conductive pili as nanowires for discharging respiratory electrons to solid-phase electron acceptors and radionuclides, or for wiring cells in current-harvesting biofilms highlights the unique physiological traits that make these organisms attractive biological platforms for bioremediation, bioenergy, and bioelectronics application. Here we review some of the most notable physiological features described in Geobacter species since the first model representatives were recovered in pure culture. We provide a historical account of the environmental research that has set the foundation for numerous physiological studies and the laboratory tools that had provided novel insights into the role of Geobacter in the functioning of microbial communities from pristine and contaminated environments. We pay particular attention to latest research, both basic and applied, that has served to expand the field into new directions and to advance interdisciplinary knowledge.

	abstract = {Zero-valent iron/activated carbon (ZVI/AC) particles can promote the reduction of U(VI) by micro-electrolysis. Therefore, they can be used to develop materials for permeable reactive barrier (PRB). In this study, citric acid (CA) mixed with ferric chloride (FeCl3) was selected as composite electrolyte, and we investigated the feasibility of electrokinetic (EK) coupled with Fe/C-PRB on the remediation of red soil artificially contaminated with U(VI). Seven EK experiments were conducted to study the effect of the type, location, and amount of PRB media on the removal of U(VI) in soil by the EK-PRB system. The results showed that the ZVI/AC mixture is superior to the single ZVI or AC as the PRB medium. For the EK-PRB system, a moderate increase in the number of PRBs and decrease in the thickness of the PRB in soil chamber can enhanced the removal of U(VI) from the contaminated soil. Under optimized conditions, after the 120 h remediation experiment obtained the maximum removal efficiency (80.58 ± 0.99%) of U(VI). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to study the surface properties of the ZVI/AC mixture before and after the reaction. The results demonstrated that the soluble U(VI) was reduced to the insoluble U(IV) in the ZVI/AC mixture, or adsorption of activated carbon or iron corrosion products regardless of the pH distribution.

	abstract = {The dispersion of 222Rn from the planned remediation of the Ranger U mine in the wet-dry tropics of Northern Australia was modelled. Dry and wet season contour maps of 222Rn dose normalised to 226Ra activity concentration in the proposed waste rock substrate on the remediated landform were developed. Three example exposure scenarios were assessed based on an anticipated waste rock 226Ra activity concentration of 800 Bq kg−1. The estimated above-background annual dose from 222Rn to hypothetical receptors at the Aboriginal community at Mudginberri (∼10 km NNW) was 0.005 mSv and at the township of Jabiru (∼7 km W) was 0.033 mSv. The estimated above-background annual dose for the hypothetical worst case scenario, representing a receptor 1 km WNW of the landform centroid during the dry season and at the centroid during the wet season, was 0.13 mSv. Variability analysis on the 20 y meteorological dataset used in the dispersion modelling showed that the dry and wet season 222Rn dose predictions in any single year could be approximately double those of an average year, which suggests that estimates of average 222Rn dose should potentially be doubled if the assessment aim is to demonstrate compliance with the public dose limit. © 2018},

This study investigated the redox reactions of sulfide with NOM to form thiol functional groups, which can greatly enhance U(VI) bioreduction and U(IV) reoxidation. Results showed that humic acid (HA) was found to be more effective than fulvic acid (FA) in producing thiol groups, both U(VI) bioreduction and U(IV) reoxidation rates increased with the increase of thiols content in HA and FA. These findings suggested that among other redox sites, thiol groups in NOM may play an important role in the electron transport between uranium and microbial cells, and are of great environmental implications because they provided direct proof that thiol groups are responsible for bioremediation and immobilization of uranium when it enters into the natural environments such as soil and groundwater. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Uranium (U) has been released to surface soil and groundwater through military and industrial activities. Soluble forms of U transferred to drinking water sources and food supplements can potentially threaten humans and the biosphere due to its chemical toxicity and radioactivity. The immobilization of aqueous U onto iron-based minerals is one of the most vital geochemical processes controlling the transport of U. As a consequence, much research has been focused on the use of iron-based materials for the treatment of U contaminated waters. One material currently being tested is nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI). However, understanding the removal mechanism of U onto nZVI is crucial to develop new technologies for contaminated water resources. This review article aims to provide information on the removal mechanism of U onto nZVI under different conditions (pH, U concentration, solution ion strength, humic acid, presence of O2 and CO2, microorganism effect) pertinent to environmental and engineered systems, and to provide risk or performance assessment results with the stability of nZVI products after removal of U in environmental restoration. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Uranium tailing is a serious pollution challenge for the environment. Based on metagenomic sequencing analysis, we explored the functional and structural diversity of the microbial community in six soil samples taken at different soil depths from uranium-contaminated and uncontaminated areas. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Orthology (KO) groups were obtained using a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool search based on the universal protein resource database. The KO-pathway network was then constructed using the selected KOs. Finally, alpha and beta diversity analyses were performed to explore the differences in soil bacterial diversity between the radioactive soil and uncontaminated soil. In total, 30–68 million high-quality reads were obtained. Sequence assembly yielded 286,615 contigs; and these contigs mostly annotated to 1699 KOs. The KO distributions were similar among the six soil samples. Moreover, the proportion of the metabolism of other amino acids (e.g., beta-alanine, taurine, and hypotaurine) and signal transduction was significantly lower in radioactive soil than in uncontaminated soil, whereas the proportion of membrane transport and carbohydrate metabolism was higher. Additionally, KOs were mostly enriched in ATP-binding cassette transporters and two-component systems. According to diversity analyses, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were the dominant phyla in radioactive and uncontaminated soil, and Robiginitalea, Microlunatus, and Alicyclobacillus were the dominant genera in radioactive soil. Taken together, these results demonstrate that soil microbial community, structure, and functions show significant changes in uranium-contaminated soil. The dominant categories such as Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria may be applied in environmental governance for uranium-contaminated soil in southern China. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {The effects of radioactive contamination on ecosystem processes such as litter decomposition remain largely unknown. Because radionuclides accumulated in soil and plant biomass can be harmful for organisms, the functioning of ecosystems may be altered by radioactive contamination. Here, we tested the hypothesis that decomposition is impaired by increasing levels of radioactivity in the environment by exposing uncontaminated leaf litter from silver birch and black alder at (i) eleven distant forest sites differing in ambient radiation levels (0.22-15 μGy h-1) and (ii) along a short distance gradient of radioactive contamination (1.2-29 μGy h-1) within a single forest in the Chernobyl exclusion zone. In addition to measuring ambient external dose rates, we estimated the average total dose rates (ATDRs) absorbed by decomposers for an accurate estimate of dose-induced ecological consequences of radioactive pollution. Taking into account potential confounding factors (soil pH, moisture, texture, and organic carbon content), the results from the eleven distant forest sites, and from the single forest, showed increased litter mass loss with increasing ATDRs from 0.3 to 150 μGy h-1. This unexpected result may be due to (i) overcompensation of decomposer organisms exposed to radionuclides leading to a higher decomposer abundance (hormetic effect), and/or (ii) from preferred feeding by decomposers on the uncontaminated leaf litter used for our experiment compared to locally produced, contaminated leaf litter. Our data indicate that radio-contamination of forest ecosystems over more than two decades does not necessarily have detrimental effects on organic matter decay. However, further studies are needed to unravel the underlying mechanisms of the results reported here, in order to draw firmer conclusions on how radio-contamination affects decomposition and associated ecosystem processes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..},

The US Department of Energy is evaluating groundwater flow and contaminant transport at a former uranium mill site near Tuba City, Arizona. They developed a groundwater flow model to determine how fast contaminants were moving towards a downgradient stream, Moenkopi Wash, used to irrigate crops. We used remote sensing algorithms and precipitation (PPT) data to estimate ET and the ET/PPT ratios within the 3513 ha groundwater model domain (GMD) from 2000 to 2012. ET and PPT were nearly balanced (125 mm yr-1 and 130 mm yr-1, respectively). However, seasonal and interannual variability in ET and PPT were out of phase. Spatial variability in vegetation differentiated areas where ET was less than PPT (potential recharge areas) from those where ET exceeded PPT (potential discharge areas) within the GMD. ET estimates predicted that 0.2 million cubic meters per year of groundwater contributed to surface flows in Moenkopi Wash, supported by measurements of streamflow at the upstream and downstream boundaries of the GMD. Even small differences between ET and PPT can influence groundwater flow, hence land use practices that enhance discharge through ET can be part of an overall remediation strategy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to present the environmental impact and health risk 20 years after the closing of the uranium mining industry. The areas under observation are 31 former classical underground uranium mining and exploratory sites in Bulgaria. The geometric mean value of the gamma dose rate (0.33 μSv h-1), measured 1 m above ground in the mining sites, was three times higher than the mean of the gamma dose in the nearby settlements (0.11 μSv h-1). The geometric mean of specific activities for 238U, 226Ra, 232Th, 40K and 210Pb in mining site soil was found to be: 437 Bq kg-1, 291 Bq kg-1, 65 Bq kg-1, 835 Bq kg-1 and 318 Bq kg-1, respectively. Analysis of variance and correlation were applied. The external dose and offsite external hazard index, as health risk indicators, were estimated based on the results. After twenty years there is still environmental contamination in some locations that may cause a health risk, so remediation and monitoring should continue and be maintained. © EDP Sciences 2016.},

	abstract = {We reconstructed the contamination history of an area influenced by 40 years of uranium mining and subsequent remediation actions using dendroanalysis (i.e., the determination of the elemental content of tree rings). The uranium content in the tree rings of four individual oak trees (Quercus sp.) was determined by laser ablation with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). This technique allows the investigation of trace metals in solid samples with a spatial resolution of 250 μm and a detection limit below 0.01 μg/g for uranium. The investigations show that in three of the four oaks sampled, there were temporally similar uranium concentrations. These were approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher (0.15 to 0.4 μg/g) than those from before the period of active mining (concentrations below 0.01 μg/g). After the mining was terminated and the area was restored, the uranium contents in the wood decreased by approximately 1 order of magnitude. The similar radial uranium distribution patterns of the three trees were confirmed by correlation analysis. In combination with the results of soil analyses, it was determined that there was a heterogeneous contamination in the forest investigated. This could be confirmed by pre-remediation soil uranium contents from literature. The uranium contents in the tree rings of the oaks investigated reflect the contamination history of the study area. This study demonstrates that the dendrochemical analysis of oak tree rings is a suitable technique for investigating past and recent uranium contamination in mining areas. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Near-surface biogeochemical systems can oscillate between oxic and anoxic conditions. Under such periodic changes many redox-sensitive inorganic contaminants undergo speciation, mobility and toxicity changes. We investigated the changes to chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), selenium (Se), antimony (Sb) and uranium (U) mobility during a series of laboratory experiments where argillaceous substrates were subjected to successive cycles of oxidizing and reducing conditions. The EH oscillated between -320 and +470 mV, induced via both abiotic and microbial forcings. Chemically induced cycles of oxidation and reduction were achieved via a combination of gas (N2:CO2 vs compressed air) and carbon (ethanol) addition, to stimulate the metabolism of a natively present microbial community. The contaminants were added either alone or as contaminant mixtures. Results show clear on-off switch mobility behavior for both major elements such as carbon (C), iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) and for contaminants. Mn, Fe, and As were mobilized under anoxic conditions, whereas Sb, Se, and U were mobilized under oxic conditions. While As, Sb, and U were reversibly sorbed, Se and Cr were irreversibly sequestered via reductive precipitation. When present in aqueous solutions at high concentrations, CrVI prevented the reduction of Mn and Fe, and inhibited the mobilization of elements with lower EHo. To improve remediation strategies for multiple contaminants in redox-dynamic environments, we propose a mixed kinetic-equilibrium biogeochemical model that can be forced by oscillating boundary conditions and that uses literature rates and constants to capture the key processes responsible for the mobilization of contaminants in soils. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The most common technology currently used for restoring groundwater at In Situ Recovery (ISR) uranium mining sites is reverse osmosis (RO) and reinjection of the permeate. However, this practice does not restore the formation to its original reduced state, and in many cases groundwater uranium concentrations are not restored to premining baseline levels. Natural attenuation based methods are rarely field tested as a small number available sites and a lack of economic interest in the mining community have historically limited their usage. This study was performed to evaluate effectiveness of introducing dissolved hydrogen into a postmined formation at an ISR mining site to stimulate reduction and immobilization of residual soluble uranium to premining baseline levels. The main objectives of this research project were (1) to develop and optimize a system for minimizing air entrainment during water injection when employing a membrane gas-transfer device for down-hole hydrogen infusion; (2) to assess whether injecting dissolved hydrogen using the membrane gas-transfer device can promote immobilization of dissolved uranium in groundwater to near or below premining concentrations. Approximately 30,000 gallons of groundwater were pumped to the surface and then reinjected into the subsurface while being supplied with dissolved hydrogen using the down-hole membrane gas infusion device. Groundwater was pumped back to the surface after several months to evaluate the extent to which dissolved uranium had been removed. Results of this study indicate an ∼83% reduction in soluble uranium concentration was achieved, while significant increases in indigenous microbial populations were observed and the hydrologic permeability of the aquifer remained in the range of clean sand. These results show enough promise to rate future exploration into the development of bio-remediation and/or membrane gas diffusion techniques as a cost effective method for post ISR mining restoration as an alternative to RO. © Copyright Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.},

	abstract = {Geoactive soil fungi were investigated for phosphatase-mediated uranium precipitation during growth on an organic phosphorus source. Aspergillus niger and Paecilomyces javanicus were grown on modified Czapek-Dox medium amended with glycerol 2-phosphate (G2P) as sole P source and uranium nitrate. Both organisms showed reduced growth on uranium-containing media but were able to extensively precipitate uranium and phosphorus-containing minerals on hyphal surfaces, and these were identified by X-ray powder diffraction as uranyl phosphate species, including potassium uranyl phosphate hydrate (KPUO6.3H2O), meta-ankoleite [(K1.7Ba0.2)(UO2)2(PO4)2.6H2O], uranyl phosphate hydrate [(UO2)3(PO4)2.4H2O], meta-ankoleite (K(UO2)(PO4).3H2O), uramphite (NH4UO2PO4.3H2O) and chernikovite [(H3O)2(UO2)2(PO4)2.6H2O]. Some minerals with a morphology similar to bacterial hydrogen uranyl phosphate were detected on A. niger biomass. Geochemical modelling confirmed the complexity of uranium speciation, and the presence of meta-ankoleite, uramphite and uranyl phosphate hydrate between pH 3 and 8 closely matched the experimental data, with potassium as the dominant cation. We have therefore demonstrated that fungi can precipitate U-containing phosphate biominerals when grown with an organic source of P, with the hyphal matrix serving to localize the resultant uranium minerals. The findings throw further light on potential fungal roles in U and P biogeochemistry as well as the application of these mechanisms for element recovery or bioremediation. © 2015 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {This is the first report on using Macleaya cordata for phytoextraction of uranium from the uranium contaminated soil in the greenhouse. Macleaya M. cordata was found to increase uranium concentration in the soil solution by increasing the dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The amendment experiments with citric acid (CA) and [S,S]-ethylenediamine disuccinic acid (EDDS) at the rates of 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 mmol kg−1 dry weight (DW) soil showed that EDDS was more efficient to increase uranium concentration in the shoot than CA when they were applied at the same rate. The applications of 5.0 mmol kg−1 EDDS and 10.0 mmol kg−1 CA were most appropriate for increasing uranium concentrations in the shoot of M. cordata. CA was more efficient to increase the solubility of uranium at the same application rates except for 2.5 mmol kg−1 application rate. There was a linear correlation between the uranium concentration in the shoot and the average uranium concentration of one planted pot during 14 days in soil solution after the application of different rates of EDDS and CA, respectively (r2 = 0.972, P < 0.01; r2 = 0.948, P < 0.01), indicating that uranium uptake was dependent on the soluble uranium concentration. The Fe-U-DOC and Mn-U-DOC complexes were probably formed after the application of CA. Soil solution pH and Fe, Mn, Ca, and DOC concentrations in soil solution were found to be changed by the chelates. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In the USA, EPA regulates the radiological clean-up of uranium mill tailings sites, some Department of Energy legacy sites within the US nuclear weapons complex, and Superfund National Priorities List sites. The approach to site remediation decisions, including the determination of clean-up levels, varies according to the enabling legislation granting EPA these authorities. Past practices that gave rise to many of the existing exposure situations at legacy sites were permissible before the advent of environmental clean-up legislation. The Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 authorised EPA to set applicable radioactivity concentration standards for soil clean-up at inactive uranium mill sites and vicinity properties. For the other categories of sites mentioned above, remediation goals are typically based on not exceeding a target excess cancer risk range established under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (also known as ‘Superfund’). EPA’s regulations for cleaning up various contaminated sites in existing exposure situations often result in residual doses that are typical of optimised doses in planned exposure situations. Although the clean-up levels selected may differ from those adopted in other countries, recommendations from the International Commission on Radiological Protection are reflected in the exposure assessment methodologies used in their establishment. © 2016, © The International Society for Prosthetics and Orthotics.},

	abstract = {Military operations of the past two decades have used depleted uranium missiles and equipment, which have contaminated the soils of war-torn areas. Once in the soil, the metal corrodes to oxidized forms whose solubility depends on soil conditions. This paper reviews the literature on the effects of depleted uranium contamination on bacteria, fungi, and plants to synthesize the research. This will enable soil microbiologists to understand the impact of uranium contamination on the ecosystem as a whole. Some bacteria thrive in high-uranium environments, but many do not, so uranium contamination selects for the bacteria that can survive. Fungi can often tolerate it quite well, to the extent that some grow on depleted uranium chips and encourage faster corrosion. Some plants can accumulate uranium, but most can only tolerate it if the pH of the soil is high enough to keep the uranium insoluble and not bioavailable. Remediation techniques include natural attenuation, ex situ processing, and bioremediation, but none of these are perfect and the correct approach depends on the site. The negative human health effects associated with uranium contamination make further research and remediation work vitally important. Copyright © 2016 by the American Society of Agronomy},

	abstract = {The capacity for subsurface sediments to sequester radionuclide contaminants, such as uranium (U), and retain them after bioremediation efforts are completed is critical to the long-term stewardship of re-mediated sites. In U bioremediation strategies, carbon amendment stimulates bioreduction of U(VI) to U(IV), immobilizing it within the sediments. Sediments enriched in natural organic matter are naturally capable of sequestering significant U, but may serve as sources to the aquifer, contributing to plume persistence. Two types of organic-rich sediments were compared to better understand U release mechanisms. Sediments that were artificially primed for U removal were retrieved from an area previously biostimulated while detrital-rich sediments were collected from a location never subject to amendment. Batch incubations demonstrated that primed sediments rapidly removed uranium from the groundwater, whereas naturally reduced sediments released a sizeable portion of U before U(VI)-reduction commenced. Column experiments confirmed that U release persisted for 65 pore volumes in naturally reduced sediments, demonstrating their sink-source behavior. Acetate addition to primed sediments shifted the microbial community from sulfate-reducing bacteria within Desulfobacteraceae to the iron-reducing Geobacteraceae and Firmicutes, associated with efficient U(VI) removal and retention, respectively. In contrast, Geobacteraceae communities in naturally reduced sediments were replaced by sequences with similarity to Pseudomonas spp. during U release, while U(VI) removal only occurred with enrichment of Firmicutes. These investigations stress the importance of characterizing zones with heterogeneous carbon pools at U-contaminated sites prior to the determination of a remedial strategy to identify areas, which may contribute to long-term sourcing of the contaminants. © 2014, National Ground Water Association.},

	abstract = {There has been a significant surge in consumption of radionuclides for various academic and commercial purposes. Correspondingly, there has been a considerable amount of generation of radioactive waste. Bacteria and archaea, being earliest inhabitants on earth serve as model microorganisms on earth. These microbes have consistently proven their mettle by surviving extreme environments, even extreme ionizing radiations. Their ability to accept and undergo stable genetic mutations have led to development of recombinant mutants that are been exploited for remediation of various pollutants such as; heavy metals, hydrocarbons and even radioactive waste (radwaste). Thus, microbes have repeatedly presented themselves to be prime candidates suitable for remediation of radwaste. It is interesting to study the behind-the-scenes interactions these microbes possess when observed in presence of radionuclides. The emphasis is on the indigenous bacteria isolated from radionuclide containing environments as well as the five fundamental interaction mechanisms that have been studied extensively, namely; bioaccumulation, biotransformation, biosorption, biosolubilisation and bioprecipitation. Application of microbes exhibiting such mechanisms in remediation of radioactive waste depends largely on the individual capability of the species. Challenges pertaining to its potential bioremediation activity is also been briefly discussed. This review provides an insight into the various mechanisms bacteria uses to tolerate, survive and carry out processes that could potentially lead the eco-friendly approach for removal of radionuclides. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The continued depletion of high-grade ores and growing awareness of environmental degradation associated with the traditional methods have provided impetus to explore simple, efficient and less polluting biological methods in uranium mining, processing, and waste water treatments (Torma, 1983; Bosecker, 1990). Hydrometallurgical methods have some disadvantages such as poor recovery, involvement of high process and energy cost, and increases in the pollution load of water resources (Bruynesteyn, 1989; Dwivedy and Mathur, 1995). Uranium could also be recovered by microorganisms that catalyse the oxidation and reduction of uranium and associated metals also, and hence influence their mobility in the environment. Industrial-scale bioleaching of uranium is carried out by spraying stope walls with acid mine drainage and the in situ irrigation of fractured underground ore deposits. The recent upsurge of interest in this area is motivated by the fact that it is simple, effective, and potentially a relatively less-expensive process involving low-energy that is environmentally benign; this is due to the uranium solubilising and accumulating properties of certain microorganisms. Besides, its industrial application to ensure the supply of raw material for producing energy, microbial leaching has a definite potential for remediation of mining sites, treatment of wastes and detoxification of sewage sludge (Brierley and Brierley, 1999). The commercial application of bioleaching of uranium from low-grade ores has been practiced since the 1960s. The seven leading uranium-producing countries in descending order are Canada, Australia, Niger, the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, Namibia and Uzbekistan. Currently, the two largest producers, namely, Canada and Australia alone account for over 50% of global uranium production. In regard to bioleaching, Canada produced about 70,000 lb of U3O8 in 1977 at Agnew Lake Mine, Ontario, Canada from its ore using Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (A. ferrooxidans) (McCready and Gould, 1990). Commercial scale experience has been limited to the operations at Denison’s Elliot Lake, Ontario, Canada in the 1980s and the dump bioleaching at the Gibraltar Mine, British Columbia. The presence of microorganisms in leaching operations has been found to be beneficial in catalysing the uranium dissolution process (Brierley, 1997; Brierley and Brierley, 1999). Currently, this technology is applied on a commercial scale not only for the recovery of uranium but also for extraction of copper, nickel, gold and so forth through heap, dump and in situ leach techniques (Torma, 1983; Torma and Banhegyi, 1984; Mwaba, 1991; Elshafeea et al., 2014).

Soil samples were taken from 58 sites using a systematic random sampling design. Selected samples were subjected to an X-ray diffractometry analysis on bulk soils and separated clay fractions. Hematite, goethite and gypsum are common mineral phases in soil samples. Technogenic soils developed on reclaimed mine spoils show uniform spatial element distribution patterns and additionally a distinct enrichment in As, Pb, Mn, U and Zn. Mineral and chemical composition of soils vs. rocks points to the lithogenic source of the determined elements. The results of chemical analysis have been used for evaluation of geochemical background of trace elements in the study area with the iterative 2σ-technique. This investigation shows that using mean crustal element concentrations (Clarke values) as proxies of threshold values in soils are not useful for determination of strongly positive geochemical anomalies.

	abstract = {A fresh sample of cinnamonic soil heavily polluted with radionuclides (U, Ra) and toxic heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Zn) was subjected to clean-up in lysimeters containing 70 kg of soil each. The clean-up was connected with solubilization of the pollutants located mainly in the horizon A, their transportation through the soil profile in soluble forms, and their precipitation in the rich-in-clay subhorizon B3. The solubilization was studied by means of different variants and it was due to the joint action of natural soil microflora and leach waters containing ammonium and phosphate ions, and in some cases-hydrocarbonate ions. Additionally, the microbial activity in some lysimeters was enhanced by mulching the top soil horizon A with finely-cut hay and maintaining optimal soil humidity by controlling the irrigation rate. After 18 months of treatment, each of the soil profiles in different lysimeters was divided into five sections reflecting the different soil layers (horizon A, and the subhorizons B1, B2, B3, B4). The soil in these sections was subjected to a detailed chemical analysis and the data obtained were compared with the relevant data obtained before the start of the treatment. It was found that considerable fractions of the pollutants were removed from the horizon A and were transported to different zones in the soil profile, mainly in the subhorizons B3 and B4. In these subhorizons the non-ferrous metals were precipitated mainly as the relevant sulphides, uranium was precipitated mainly as uraninite (UO2), and radium-mainly as adsorbed ions and complexes. The transport and precipitation of pollutants depended strongly on the pH, the content of dissolved organic compounds in the soil solutions, and the prevailing anaerobic conditions maintained into deeper soil horizons. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

However, certain conventional techniques like high-temperature incineration, chemical methods, and various higher decomposition techniques are practiced for cleaning up contaminated sites. But, these processes do not lead to the final destruction of pollutants. Therefore, to overcome these problems, environmentalists are looking toward microbes such as bacterial/fungi/algae/yeast/cyanobacteria, etc., green plants, or their enzymes to remediate environmental pollutants from contaminated sites. Microbes have the ability to thrive in “adverse conditions” of high acidity/alkalinity/toxicity and temperature. Under favorable conditions, these degrade/transform toxic environmental pollutants into simpler and harmless ones. Some bacteria can also ingest the most toxic “cyanide” from contaminated soils/water. After the use of “super bugs” in the cleaning up of oil spills, there have been several successful stories of microbial techniques in the cleaning up of the contaminated sites. Plants involved in bioremediation processes are also adapted to thrive in very harsh environmental conditions and absorb, tolerate, transfer, assimilate, degrade, and stabilize toxic pollutants such as heavy metals, radionuclides, solvents, crude oil, pesticides, explosives, chlorinated compounds, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons from the contaminated sites (Chandra et al. 2015). © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

There are many gaps in our understanding of the characteristics and mechanisms of plant radionuclide accumulation, including the importance of symbiotically-associated arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. We first briefly review the evidence that demonstrates the ability of AM fungi to enhance the translocation of238U into plant root tissues, and how fungal association may prevent further mobilization into shoot tissues. We then focus on approaches that should further advance our knowledge of AM fungi–plant radionuclide accumulation. Current research has mostly used artificial cultivation methods and we consider how more ecologically-relevant analysis might be performed. The use of synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence imaging and absorption spectroscopy techniques to understand the mechanisms of radionuclide transfer from soil to plant via AM fungi is evaluated. Without such further knowledge, the behavior and mobilization of radionuclides cannot be accurately modeled and the potential risks cannot be accurately predicted. © 2015 Davies, Cox, Robinson and Pittman.},

	abstract = {The old Senhora das Fontes uranium mine, located in central Portugal, was closed down in 1971. The treatment of ores from this mine and other mines by heap-leach ended in 1982. Seven dumps partially covered by vegetation were left in the area. Soil and stream sediment samples were collected in December 2009. The remediation was carried out from May 2010 to January 2011. Stream sediment samples were collected again in October 2013. Before the remediation, soils from inside the mine influence area have higher Al, As, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Sr, Th, U and Zn concentrations than soils from outside this area, due to radionuclides, metals and metalloid released from the mine dumps. The principal component analysis (PCA) shows a distinction between soils from inside and outside the mine influence area. The U(VI), As(V) and metals from soils can be adsorbed to Fe-oxyhydroxides and the humic acid can increase the U uptake. Soils must not be used for public or private green and residential areas, because they are contaminated in U, As, Co, Cd and Ni. Before the remediation, downstream sediments have higher Al, As, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, U and Zn than upstream sediments, due to erosion and percolation of water through the mine dumps. The PCA shows a distinction between downstream and upstream sediments. The U(VI), Th and As(V) can be adsorbed to Fe-oxyhydroxides. The stream sediments are contaminated in As, Mn, Th and U. Downstream sediments are the most contaminated in U and As. After the remediation, upstream and downstream sediments have generally higher Al, Fe, As, Cr, Ni, Th, U and Zn concentrations than before the remediation, attributed to the relocation of dumps. Radionuclides, metals and metalloids were transported by surface water. Consequently downstream sediments have higher Al, As, Cu, Mn, Ni, Th, U and Zn concentrations than upstream sediments. The U(VI), Th and As(V) can be adsorbed to Fe-oxyhydroxides. Stream sediments became more contaminated in U, Th and As than before the remediation, but more intensively downstream. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Contamination of environment by uranium is expected in places where mining of uranium ore and processing, nuclear testing and reactor operations when the control measures are not effective. The daughter radionuclides of the ores, chemical additives and residual uranium are the maincomponents of processed waste from uranium industries. The bioremediation of contaminated areas using plant species or group of the plant may offer a cheap, renewable and promising approach to ensure long-term protection to the environment. In view of this, experiments were carried out to study the uranium immobilization potential of vetiver grass (Chrysopogon zizanioides (L.) Nash) under simulated conditions using the complex tailings. The vetiver plants were planted in simulation tanks at Health Physics Unit (HPU), Jaduguda, Jharkhand, India and periodic samplings were carried out to investigate the extent of uranium uptake. The acid aliquot of ashed plant samples, soil and tailings were subjected to solvent extraction followed by UV-Fluorimeter for estimation of uranium. The studies indicated that the plant species could bioremediate up to 49% of the uranium at 90th day of the experiment and the uranium remediation efficiency of vetiver increased with time and uranium was predominantly localized in the roots of the plant. © 2016 Shanmugasundaram, H., Sathesh Kumar Annamalai, Kantha Deivi Arunachalam, V.N.

	abstract = {In order to find out the spatial distribution characteristics and pollution levels of uranium in the soils around uranium tailings, portable XRF elemental analyzer was applied to analyze and test in-situ, and SPSS software was used to analyze in-situ test data. The results show that the content of uranium in soil is 4 times and 2.3 times as many as the soil element background values of China and the province of research area. The variable coefficient of the uranium content is 61.84% in soil samples, which shows that contents of uranium are up to standard of strong variation. The frequency statistics of the uranium content in the soil samples is similar to skew normal distribution, which indicates that the soils around the uranium tailings have been polluted to some extent. Based on the results of statistical analysis, single contamination index, geoaccumulation index method and ArcGIS were used to estimate spatial distribution characteristics and pollution level of uranium in the soils around the uranium tailings. The pollution assessment results show that the main pollution areas concentrate in the range of 0 m to 500 m around the uranium tailings dam and 0 m to 100 m around the emergency treatment pool in the NE of the uranium tailings. The evaluation results can provide the basic data for carrying out phytoremediation and treating of uranium tailings. © 2017, Editorial Board of Atomic Energy Science and Technology.

	abstract = {Cell suspensions of Pelosinus sp. strain UFO1 were previously shown, using spectroscopic analysis, to sequester uranium as U(IV) complexed with carboxyl and phosphoryl group ligands on proteins. The goal of our present study was to characterize the proteins involved in uranium binding. Virtually all of the uranium in UFO1 cells was associated with a heterodimeric protein, which was termed the uranium-binding complex (UBC). The UBC was composed of two S-layer domain proteins encoded by UFO1_4202 and UFO1_4203. Samples of UBC purified from the membrane fraction contained 3.3 U atoms/heterodimer, but significant amounts of phosphate were not detected. The UBC had an estimated molecular mass by gel filtration chromatography of 15 MDa, and it was proposed to contain 150 heterodimers (UFO1_4203 and UFO1_4202) and about 500 uranium atoms. The UBC was also the dominant extracellular protein, but when purified from the growth medium, it contained only 0.3 U atoms/heterodimer. The two genes encoding the UBC were among the most highly expressed genes within the UFO1 genome, and their expressions were unchanged by the presence or absence of uranium. Therefore, the UBC appears to be constitutively expressed and is the first line of defense against uranium, including by secretion into the extracellular medium. Although S-layer proteins were previously shown to bind U(VI), here we showed that U(IV) binds to S-layer proteins, we identified the proteins involved, and we quantitated the amount of uranium bound. © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.

	abstract = {Extensive uranium mining in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) in eastern Thuringia and Saxony took place during the period of 1946–1990. During mining activities, pelitic sediments rich in organic carbon and uranium were processed and exposed to oxygen. Subsequent pyrite oxidation and acidic leaching lead to partial contamination of the area with heavy metals and acid mine drainage (AMD) even few years after completion of remediation. One of those areas is the former heap Gessen (Ronneburg, Germany) were the residual contamination can be found 10 m under the base of the former heap containing partly permeable drainage channels. Actually, in such a system, a rapid but locally restricted mineralization of Mn oxides takes place under acidic conditions. This formation can be classified as a natural attenuation process as certain heavy metals, e.g., Cd (up to 6 μg/g), Ni (up to 311 μg/g), Co (up to 133 μg/g), and Zn (up to 104 μg/g) are bound to this phases. The secondary minerals occur as colored layers close to the shallow aquifer in glacial sediments and could be identified as birnessite and todorokite as Mn phase. The thermodynamic model shows that even small changes in the system are sufficient to shift either the pH or the Eh in the direction of stable Mn oxide phases in this acidic system. As a consequence of 9–15-year-long formation process (or even less), the supergene mineralization provides a cost-efficient contribution for remediation (natural attenuation) strategies of residual with heavy metals (e.g., Cd, Co, Ni, Zn) contaminated substrates. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {The influence of U(VI)-CO3 and Ca-U(VI)-CO3 complexes on U(VI) adsorption onto red soil and nanoscale zero-valent iron (NZVI) was investigated using batch adsorption and fixed-bed column experiments to simulate the feasibility of NZVI as the reactive medium in permeable- reactive barriers (PRB) for in situ remediation of uranium-contaminated red soils. The adsorption capacity (qe) and distribution constant (Kd) of NZVI and red soil decreased with increasing pH, dissolved carbonate and calcium concentrations, but the qe and Kd values of NZVI were 5-10 times higher than those of red soil. The breakthrough pore volume (PV) values increased with the decrease of pH, dissolved carbonate and calcium concentration; however, the breakthrough PV values of the PRB column filled with 5% NZVI were 2.0-3.5 times higher than the 100% red soil column. The U(VI)-CO3 complexes adsorbed onto the surface of red soil/NZVI (SOH) to form SO-UO2CO3- or SO-UO2 (CO3)23-. XPS and XRD analysis further confirmed the reduction of U(VI) to U(IV) and the formation of FeOOH on NZVI surfaces.

	abstract = {Following the development of nuclear science and technology, uranium contamination has been an ever increasing concern worldwide because of its potential for migration from the waste repositories and long-term contaminated environments. Physical and chemical techniques for uranium pollution are expensive and challenging. An alternative to these technologies is microbially mediated uranium bioremediation in contaminated water and soil environments due to its reduced cost and environmental friendliness. To date, four basic mechanisms of uranium bioremediation—uranium bioreduction, biosorption, biomineralization, and bioaccumulation—have been established, of which uranium bioreduction and biomineralization have been studied extensively. The objective of this review is to provide an understanding of recent developments in these two fields in relation to relevant microorganisms, mechanisms, influential factors, and obstacles. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Uranium mill tailings are the crushed rock residues of the uranium extraction process from ores. The tailings effluent and tailings solids from the mill are discharged as slurry to a waste retention pond, called tailing pond. Natural radionuclides’ and trace metals are present in mine tailing/soil in varying concentrations, and some of these are found in elevated concentrations in uranium waste tailings. Uranium mine tailing ponds at Jaduguda and Turamdih receive waste from ores mined at the six mine stations at Jharkhand state, India. A study was undertaken to evaluate the potential of native plant species for the phytoremediation of these site. Three sampling stations were selected at Jaduguda (TP1, TP2, TP3) and Turamdih and at the downstream of effluent treatment plant. pH, electrical conductivity, metals (12-Al, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Cd, Pb) and radionuclides’ (3-Co, Sr and U) were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrophotometry. From the analysis, four elements—Al, Mn, Fe and U—were found to be much higher in concentration in water with range (mg/kg) of 0.02–2.38, 0.30–31.67, 0.00–0.75 and 0.03–5.50, respectively, and 10 elements—of U, Mn, Al, V, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Co and Se—were found to be higher in concentrations in soils with range (mg/kg) of 22–99, 1,072–8,065, 14,053–21,213, 66–139, 15,163–44,640, 149–240, 135–350, 89–191, 34–140 and 12–122, respectively. Among them, U and Mn were identified as predominant contaminants. Out of all the native plants, 21 species were screened for phytoaccumulation and transfer factor study. P. digitalis (for Al, V, Ni and Co), E. ferox (for Mn and Cu), A. indica (for Fe), B. vitisidae (for Zn), P. hydropiper (for Se) and S. spantanium (for U) were identified for hyper-accumulation, and A. indica (for Al, Co, Se and U), C. bunplandianus (for Mn, Fe, Ni and Cu), E. ferox (for V) and C. procera (for Zn) were listed for non-accumulation of respective contaminant. Besides this, taking consideration of the parameters such as shallow-rooted plant species, easy to adapt, growth, harvest and biomass production and simultaneous accumulation of multiple contaminants, following plants were found to be candidate species for phytoremediation of tailing ponds of uranium mines: For hyper-accumulation: P. vittata (can accumulate Al, V, Ni, Co, Se and U simultaneously) followed by P. digitalis, C. compressus and S. spantanium. For non-accumulation: C. bunplandianus (can non-accumulate Al, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, Se and U simultaneously) followed by B. moneri, C. procera and A. indica. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {Characterisation of soils and establishment of heavy metal and radionuclide concentrations prior to mining disturbance provides an essential benchmark for post-mining reclamation. Land disturbance from uranium mining could result in metal contamination of surface soils with subsequent negative impacts on soil quality and human and ecosystem health. This soil characterization study was conducted because there is no background data of soil trace metals and radionuclide for this region. These benchmark data are essential for post-mining monitoring and possible future remediation. The planned conventional open pit mine will produce 15,000 and 50,000 tonnes (ore and waste rock) per day. The envisaged overburden and waste dumps are likely to enhance potential for heavy metal contamination of soils. To establish the baseline data and pre-mining site environmental conditions, (1) the physico-chemical properties of soils and (2) potential heavy metal and radionuclide pollutants in identified different sites were determined. The sampling sites were selected based on the variation in soil classes in the study area. The physico-chemical properties were measured using the standard methods while heavy metals were analysed using a Finnigan MAT Element 2 high resolution Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer. The following heavy metals and radionuclides were determined: Th, U, Sr, Ba, Be, Cd, Pb, V, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn and Co. Most soils are predominately sandy clay (>17.2 %) suggesting their suitability for agricultural use. The results also indicate that most heavy metals were at or below expected ranges for non-contaminated soils and there was no evidence of any geochemical anomalies. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Ore mining and processing have greatly altered ecosystems, often limiting their capacity to provide ecosystem services critical to our survival. The soil environments of two abandoned uranium mines were chosen to analyze the effects of long-term uranium and heavy metal contamination on soil microbial communities using dehydrogenase and phosphatase activities as indicators of metal stress. The levels of soil contamination were low, ranging from ‘precaution’ to ‘moderate’, calculated as Nemerow index. Multivariate analyses of enzyme activities revealed the following: (i) spatial pattern of microbial endpoints where the more contaminated soils had higher dehydrogenase and phosphatase activities, (ii) biological grouping of soils depended on both the level of soil contamination and management practice, (iii) significant correlations between both dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase activities and soil organic matter and metals (Cd, Co, Cr, and Zn, but not U), and (iv) multiple relationships between the alkaline than the acid phosphatase and the environmental factors. The results showed an evidence of microbial tolerance and adaptation to the soil contamination established during the long-term metal exposure and the key role of soil organic matter in maintaining high microbial enzyme activities and mitigating the metal toxicity. Additionally, the results suggested that the soil microbial communities are able to reduce the metal stress by intensive phosphatase synthesis, benefiting a passive environmental remediation and provision of vital ecosystem services. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Recent information obtained using batch sorption studies is summarized and the adsorption mechanisms involved, regarding various aquatic and soil pollutants (metal ions, dyes, radionuclides, phenolic compounds, pesticides) are presented and discussed. It is evident that several biosorbents show the potential to effectively remove a wide variety of pollutants from aqueous solutions, especially Pb and Cd. However, there is need to (a) develop standardized batch study protocols, and potentially reference materials, for effective cross-evaluation of biosorbents of similar nature and for improved understanding of mechanisms involved and (b) investigate scaling-up and regeneration issues that hold back industry-level application of preselected adsorbents. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Rapid industrialization and urbanization have resulted in elevated concentrations of hazardous inorganic and organic contaminants in groundwater and soil, which has become a paramount concern to the environment and the public health. In recent years, iron sulfide (FeS), a major constituent of acid-volatile sulfides, has elicited extensive interests in environmental remediation due to its ubiquitous presence and high treatment efficiency in anoxic environment. This paper provides a comprehensive review on recent advances in: (1) synthesis of FeS particles (including nanoscale FeS); and (2) reactivity of FeS towards a variety of common environmental contaminants in groundwater and soil over extended periods of time, namely, heavy metals (Hg(II), Cu(II), Pb(II), and Cr(VI)), oxyanions (arsenite, arsenate, selenite, and selenate), radionuclides (e.g., uranium (U) and neptunium (Np)), chlorinated organic compounds (e.g., trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, and p-chloroaniline), nitroaromatic compounds, and polychlorinated biphenyls. Different physiochemical and biological methods for preparing FeS with desired particle size, structure, and surface properties are discussed. Reaction principles and removal effectiveness/constraints are discussed in details. Special attention is placed to the application of nanoscale FeS particles because of their unique properties, such as small particle size, large specific surface area, high surface reactivity, and soil deliverability in the subsurface. Moreover, current knowledge gaps and further research needs are identified. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

Our studies indicated that approximately 16.0% of U(VI) at an initial concentration of 100 mg/L uranium nitrate could be reduced by Bacillus sp. dwc-2 at pH 8.2 under anaerobic conditions at room temperature. Additionally, natural organic matter (NOM) played an important role in enhancing the bioreduction of U(VI) by Bacillus sp. dwc-2. XPS results demonstrated that the uranium presented mixed valence states (U(VI) and U(IV)) after bioreduction, which was subsequently confirmed by XANES. Furthermore, the TEM and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis suggested that the reduced uranium was bioaccumulated mainly within the cell and as a crystalline structure on the cell wall. These observations implied that the reduction of uranium may have a significant effect on its fate in the soil environment in which these bacterial strains occur. © 2016},

Results showed that V S. alfredii exhibited higher U content in the roots than the other four plants and with the increase of U concentration in the solution, the U uptake by V S. alfredii and W S. alfredii increased. The results also showed that different U speciation in different cultivation solution took an important role on the uptake of U in variant Sedum alfredii: at pH 6.5, U hydrolysis species (UO2)3(OH)5         +is predominant and the U concentrations in V S. alfredii roots reached a maximum value (3.7 × 104 mg/kg). U complexation with carbonates, phosphates, and some organic acids in the solution resulted in a decrease in the U content in the roots except for lactic acid. Our researches highlight the correlations between U speciation and the uptake on V S.

	abstract = {In the recent decades phytoremediation became an emerging technology for the stabilization and rehabilitation of slightly to medium heavy metal contaminated sites, as well as of mining sites. In previous own studies the general suitability of Helianthus tuberosus under slightly acidic soil pH and increased heavy metal (HM) concentrations was successfully tested. Phytoremediation was here investigated as a suitable remediation method for the stabilization of a U mining site near Ronneburg in Thuringia/ Germany. In the experiments presented here, the uptake of heavy metals/ radionuclides (HM/R) of H. tuberosus from test field substrate with different soil additives and mineral fertilizers under variation of soil pH was tested in pot and real field experiments. Compost was added in different masses (40 – 120 t/ha), and CaO was added in several experiments. The test field soil without additives (pH 4.65) was applied as control experiment. Good growth yields for tubers and shoot biomass were achieved for the addition of compost and CaO, but also for N-fertilization. The highest metal concentrations were achieved at the test field site for Al with 2.1 g/kg in roots at an N-fertilized soil of pH 4.6, furthermore 2.4 g/kg Fe, 0.66 g/kg Mn, 0.9 mg/kg U in the roots and 1.9 g/kg Mn in shoots (transfer factor 2.8). Good metal transfer factors were also achieved for Zn, Cd and Co. As a conclusion from these results, H. tuberosus is suited as a plant for phytostabilization and phytoextraction at such a site and for the subsequent winning of bioenergy. It was growing successful under the rough soil and climatic conditions at this test field site. © 2017 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The bioreduction of uranium may immobilize a significant fraction of this toxic contaminant in reduced environments at circumneutral pH. In oxic and low pH environments, however, the low solubility of U(VI)-phosphate minerals also makes them good candidates for the immobilization of U(VI) in the solid phase. As inorganic phosphate is generally scarce in soils, the biomineralization of U(VI)-phosphate minerals via microbially-mediated organophosphate hydrolysis may represent the main immobilization process of uranium in these environments. In this study, contaminated sediments were incubated aerobically in two pH conditions to examine whether phytate, a naturally-occurring and abundant organophosphate in soils, could represent a potential phosphorous source to promote U(VI)-phosphate biomineralization by natural microbial communities. While phytate hydrolysis was not evident at pH 7.0, nearly complete hydrolysis was observed both with and without electron donor at pH 5.5, suggesting indigenous microorganisms express acidic phytases in these sediments. While the rate of hydrolysis of phytate generally increased in the presence of uranium, the net rate of inorganic phosphate production in solution was decreased and inositol phosphate intermediates were generated in contrast to similar incubations conducted without uranium. These findings suggest uranium stress enhanced the phytate-metabolism of the microbial community, while simultaneously inhibiting phosphatase production and/or activity by the indigenous population. Finally, phytate hydrolysis drastically decreased uranium solubility, likely due to formation of ternary sorption complexes, U(VI)-phytate precipitates, and U(VI)-phosphate minerals. Overall, the results of this study provide evidence for the ability of natural microbial communities to liberate phosphate from phytate in acidic sediments, possibly as a detoxification mechanism, and demonstrate the potential utility of phytate-promoted uranium immobilization in subsurface environments. These processes should be investigated in more detail with pure cultures isolated from these sediments. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Uranium is a naturally occurring radioactive heavy metal generally found in trace quantities in various matrices such as soil, rock and water resources. Recent reports on higher level of uranium in water resources at various locations have created interest on determining quantities of uranium in water from different locations and possible implications to health effects. Recent results from our laboratory on determination of uranium in drinking and river water are described. Variations are reported at different locations in Districts of Eastern Uttar Pradesh but they are within permissible limits. Level of uranium in human body beyond permissible limit poses various radiological and chemical hazards. Extensive studies on effects of uranium on microbes, plants and animal models have yielded invaluable results. It was found that chemical effects of uranium were more predominant than its radiological toxicities. The toxicity mechanism of uranium continues enigmatic but involves a wide range of physicochemical and cytological factors. This chapter describes various natural and man-made sources, gives results of biological toxicity studies and outlines current methods for remediation.

	abstract = {Remediating uranium contamination is of worldwide interest because of the increasing release of uranium from mining and processing, nuclear power leaks, depleted uranium components in weapons production and disposal, and phosphate fertilizer in agriculture activities. Iron-based technologies are attractive because they are highly efficient, inexpensive, and readily available. This paper provides an overview of the current literature that addresses the application of iron-based technologies in the remediation of sites with elevated uranium levels. The application of iron-based materials, the current remediation technologies and mechanisms, and the effectiveness and environmental safety considerations of these approaches were discussed. Because uranium can be reduced and reoxidized in the environment, the review also proposes strategies for long-term in situ remediation of uranium. Unfortunately, iron-based materials (nanoscale zerovalent iron and iron oxides) can be toxic to microorganisms. As such, further studies exploring the links among the fates, ecological impacts, and other environmentally relevant factors are needed to better understand the constraints on using iron-based technologies for remediation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Environmental pollution from hazardous waste materials, organic pollutants and heavy metals, has adversely affected the natural ecosystem to the detriment of man. These pollutants arise from anthropogenic sources as well as natural disasters such as hurricanes and volcanic eruptions. Toxic metals could accumulate in agricultural soils and get into the food chain, thereby becoming a major threat to food security. Conventional and physical methods are expensive and not effective in areas with low metal toxicity. Bioremediation is therefore an eco-friendly and efficient method of reclaiming environments contaminated with heavy metals by making use of the inherent biological mechanisms of microorganisms and plants to eradicate hazardous contaminants. This review discusses the toxic effects of heavy metal pollution and the mechanisms used by microbes and plants for environmental remediation. It also emphasized the importance of modern biotechnological techniques and approaches in improving the ability of microbial enzymes to effectively degrade heavy metals at a faster rate, highlighting recent advances in microbial bioremediation and phytoremediation for the removal of heavy metals from the environment as well as future prospects and limitations. However, strict adherence to biosafety regulations must be followed in the use of biotechnological methods to ensure safety of the environment. © 2017 by the authors.},

Neglecting adhering particles in plant tissue leads to misinterpretation of trace element concentrations in research fields such as phytomining, phytoremediation, bio-monitoring, uptake of micronutrients and provenance studies. In case washing or brushing the samples prior to analysis is insufficient or impossible due to fragile or pre-processed samples mathematical correction should be applied. In this study three methods are presented allowing to subtract the influence of adhering particles in order to obtain the element concentrations in plants resulting only from uptake. All mathematical models are based on trace elements with negligible soil to plant transfer. A prerequisite for the correction methods is trace element analytics with good accuracy and high precision, e.g. through complete acid digestion. In a data set of 1040 plant samples grown in open field and pot trials most plants show a small but detectable amount of adhering particles. While concentrations of nutrients are nearly unaffected trace element concentrations such as Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, REEs, Ti and U may be significantly altered. Different sampling techniques like cutting height can also significantly alter the concentrations measured in the samples. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Wildlife concentration ratios for 226Ra, 210Pb, 210Po and isotopes of Th and U from soil, water, and sediments were evaluated for a range of Australian uranium mining environments. Whole-organism concentration ratios (CRwo-media) were developed for 271 radionuclide-organism pairs within the terrestrial and freshwater wildlife groups. Australian wildlife often has distinct physiological attributes, such as the lower metabolic rates of macropod marsupials as compared with placental mammals. In addition, the Australian CRswo-media originate from tropical and semi-arid climates, rather than from the temperate-dominated climates of Europe and North America from which most (>90%) of internationally available CRwo-media values originate. When compared, the Australian and non-Australian CRs are significantly different for some wildlife categories (e.g. grasses, mammals) but not others (e.g. shrubs). Where differences exist, the Australian values were higher, suggesting that site-, or region-specific CRswo-media should be used in detailed Australian assessments. However, in screening studies, use of the international mean values in the Wildlife Transfer Database (WTD) appears to be appropriate, as long as the values used encompass the Australian 95th percentile values. Gaps in the Australian datasets include a lack of marine parameters, and no CR data are available for freshwater phytoplankton, zooplankton, insects, insect larvae or amphibians; for terrestrial environments, there are no data for amphibians, annelids, ferns, fungi or lichens & bryophytes. The new Australian specific parameters will aide in evaluating remediation plans and ongoing operations at mining and waste sites within Australia. They have also substantially bolstered the body of U- and Th-series CRwo-media data for use internationally. © 2017 The Authors},

	abstract = {Natural examples demonstrate uranyl-phosphate minerals can maintain extremely low levels of aqueous uranium in groundwaters due to their low solubility. Therefore, greater understanding of the geochemical factors leading to uranyl phosphate precipitation may lead to successful application of phosphate-based remediation methods. However, the solubility of uranyl phosphate phases varies over >3 orders of magnitude, with the most soluble phases typically observed in lab experiments. To understand the role of common soil/sediment mineral surfaces in the nucleation and transformation of uranyl phosphate minerals under environmentally relevant conditions, batch experiments were carried out with goethite and mica at pH 6 in mixed electrolyte solutions ranging from 1-800. μM U and 1-800. μM P. All experiments ended with uranium concentrations below the USEPA MCL for U, but with 2-3 orders of magnitude difference in uranium concentrations. Despite the presence of many cations that are well known to incorporate into less soluble autunite-group minerals, chernikovite rapidly precipitated in all experiments containing U and P, except for solutions with 1. μM U and 1. μM P that were calculated to be undersaturated. Textures of uranyl phosphates observed by AFM and TEM indicate that nucleation was homogenous and independent of the initial mineral content. Comparison of time-course U and P concentrations from the experiments with thermodynamic modeling of solution equilibria demonstrated that aqueous uranium concentrations in the experimental systems evolved as increasingly sparingly soluble uranyl phosphate phases nucleated over time, with sorption accelerating the transition between phases by influencing solution chemistry. Aqueous uranium concentrations consistent with partially dehydrated (meta-) autunite were achieved only in experiments containing goethite and/or mica. These dynamic nucleation-growth-sorption-nucleation-growth-sorption cycles occur over the time scales of weeks, not hours or days at room temperature. Lab experiments and field-based investigations of uranium phosphate should consider these or longer time scales for the greatest long-term relevance. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {To explore the effects of citric acid concentration on the remediation of uranium contaminated soil by Lolium perenne and it's physiological characteristics,pot experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of different citric acid concentrations (0,1,5,10 mmol/kg) on the growth, physiology and uranium accumulation and distribution of Lolium perenne under the environment of 15 mg/kg uranium stress. The results show that with the increase of citric acid concentrations, cell inclusion parameters including growth, photosynthetic pigments, soluble protein content, root vitality, and the activities of glutathione and several enzymes, in Lolium perenne firstly increase and then decrease. The membranous permeability, malondialdehyde contents and oxidised glutathione contents gradually increase. The uranium contents in various Lolium perenne positions firstly increase and then decrease, but the uranium contents in the root are much higher than those in the above-ground parts. The subcellular uranium distributions in cells show that the enrichment of uranium is cell wall and residue part>soluble part>organelles and membrane parts, and the enrichment of uranium firstly increases and then decreases under the same concentration of uranium. The electron microscopy images show that the environment of uranium stress can lead to irreversible damage on Lolium perenne ultrastructures, while the addition of 5 mmol/kg citric acid can reduce the damage degree. It is concluded that citric acid with low concentrations of 1 and 5 mmol/kg can promote the growth and remediation efficiency of Lolium perenne in uranium contaminated soil. And 5 mmol/kg citric acid can reach the best effect, while 10 mmol/kg can limit the growth of Lolium perenne. © 2016, Editorial Board of Atomic Energy Science and Technology. All right reserved.},

	abstract = {Baseline terrestrial gamma radiation maps are indispensable for providing basic reference information that may be used in assessing the impact of a radiation related incident, performing epidemiological studies, remediating land contaminated with radioactive materials, assessment of land use applications and resource prospectivity. For a large land mass, such as Queensland, Australia (over 1.7 million km2), it is prohibitively expensive and practically difficult to undertake detailed in-situ radiometric surveys of this scale. It is proposed that an existing, ultra-low density sampling program already undertaken for the purpose of a nationwide soil survey project be utilised to develop a baseline terrestrial gamma radiation map. Geoelement data derived from the National Geochemistry Survey of Australia (NGSA) was used to construct a baseline terrestrial gamma air kerma rate map, delineated by major drainage catchments, for Queensland. Three drainage catchments (sampled at the catchment outlet) spanning low, medium and high radioelement concentrations were selected for validation of the methodology using radiometric techniques including in-situ measurements and soil sampling for high resolution gamma spectrometry, and comparative non-radiometric analysis. A Queensland mean terrestrial air kerma rate, as calculated from the NGSA outlet sediment uranium, thorium and potassium concentrations, of 49 ± 69 nGy h-1 (n = 311, 3σ 99% confidence level) is proposed as being suitable for use as a generic terrestrial air kerma rate background range. Validation results indicate that catchment outlet measurements are representative of the range of results obtained across the catchment and that the NGSA geoelement data is suitable for calculation and mapping of terrestrial air kerma rate. © 2015 .},

	abstract = {Remediation of uranium in the deep unsaturated zone is a challenging task, especially in the presence of oxygenated, high-carbonate alkalinity soil and pore water composition typical for arid and semi-arid environments of the western regions of the U.S. This study evaluates the effect of various pore water constituencies on changes of uranium concentrations in alkaline conditions, created in the presence of reactive gases such as NH3 to effectively mitigate uranium contamination in the vadose zone sediments. This contaminant is a potential source for groundwater pollution through slow infiltration of soluble and highly mobile uranium species towards the water table. The objective of this research was to evaluate uranium sequestration efficiencies in the alkaline synthetic pore water solutions prepared in a broad range of Si, Al, and bicarbonate concentrations typically present in field systems of the western U.S. regions and identify solid uranium-bearing phases that result from ammonia gas treatment. In previous studies (Szecsody et al. 2012; Zhong et al. 2015), although uranium mobility was greatly decreased, solid phases could not be identified at the low uranium concentrations in field-contaminated sediments. The chemical composition of the synthetic pore water used in the experiments varied for silica (5–250 mM), Al3+ (2.8 or 5 mM), HCO3− (0–100 mM) and U(VI) (0.0021–0.0084 mM) in the solution mixture. Experiment results suggested that solutions with Si concentrations higher than 50 mM exhibited greater removal efficiencies of U(VI). Solutions with higher concentrations of bicarbonate also exhibited greater removal efficiencies for Si, Al, and U(VI). Overall, the silica polymerization reaction leading to the formation of Si gel correlated with the removal of U(VI), Si, and Al from the solution. If no Si polymerization was observed, there was no U removal from the supernatant solution. Speciation modeling indicated that the dominant uranium species in the presence of bicarbonate were anionic uranyl carbonate complexes (UO2(CO3)2−2 and UO2(CO3)3−4) and in the absence of bicarbonate in the solution, U(VI) major species appeared as uranyl-hydroxide (UO2(OH)3− and UO2(OH)4−2) species. The model also predicted the formation of uranium solid phases. Uranyl carbonates as rutherfordine [UO2CO3], cejkaite [Na4(UO2)(CO3)3] and hydrated uranyl silicate phases as Na-boltwoodite [Na(UO2)(SiO4)·1.5H2O] were anticipated for most of the synthetic pore water compositions amended from medium (2.9 mM) to high (100 mM) bicarbonate concentrations. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Iron oxide nanoparticles in natural soils and sediments can be nanoporous due to the aggregation of nanoparticles. Nanopores can greatly affect the sorption-desorption as well as reduction-oxidation behavior of U(VI) because of their high internal surface area and nanopore confinement effects. Batch U(VI) sorption-desorption experiments were conducted to understand the role of nano-goethite in controlling U(VI) sorption-desorption behavior in saprolite subsoil from Oak Ridge Field Research Center (ORFRC), Tennessee, a premier field research site for environmental remediation. The subsoil samples from ~ 6.5–8.5 m depth were nearly homogeneous in mineral composition (quartz, illite and smectite) and particle size distribution. The subsoil samples were characterized by a range of dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (DCB) extractable Fe(III) oxide content (127–404 μM/g), BET surface area (25–38 m2/g), and nanoporosity (pore size < 10 nm; 16–30 μL/g). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses revealed that aggregated goethite nano-crystals were poorly crystalline and nanoporous, and U(VI) sorption was dominantly associated with those nanoporous goethite aggregates rather than clay minerals. U(VI) sorption to the saprolite subsoils at circumneutral pH increased with higher amount of nanoporous goethite in the presence of a range of Ca2 + and HCO3−. Sequential extraction of U(VI) pre-sorbed to saprolite subsoils with NaHCO3 (1, 10, and 100 mM) exhibited more resistant U(VI) desorption from soils containing higher amount of nanoporous goethite. This study suggests that nano-crystalline goethite with nanoporous structure may exert a significant role in controlling the mobility and transport of U(VI) in subsurface environment where nanoporous minerals are ubiquitous and abundant. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Our data showed that the bacteria isolated from uranium mine possessed highly accumulation ability to U(VI), and the maximum accumulation capacity was around 400mg U/g biomass (dry weight). X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analyzes indicated that the U(VI) was adsorbed on the bacterial surface firstly through coordinating with phosphate, CH2 and amide groups, and then needle-like amorphous uranium compounds were formed. With the extension of time, the extracellular crystalline substances were disappeared, but some particles were appeared in the intracellular region, and these particles were characterized as tetragonal-uramphite. Moreover, the disrupted experiment indicated that the cell-free extracts had better uranium-immobilization ability than cell debris. Our findings provided the understanding of the uranium transformation process from amorphous uranium to crystalline uramphite, which would be useful in the regulation of uranium immobilization process. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Experimental investigations were performed on three types of soils, which have been characterized in terms of particle size distribution, structure and chemical composition. For radioactive decontamination of the soil the bio-remediation technique was applied by using two species of mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus, Agaricus bisporus), at temperature of 25°± 2°C in a climatic chamber for a 6 weeks period of time. Results showed that both species grew in the presence of uranium. Decontamination tests have revealed a degree of decontamination of 31%for soil 1 (sandy soil) using Pleurotus Ostreatus and 19%using Agaricus Bisporus. For soil 2 (with a large content of clay) the decontamination degree is 27%using Pleurotus Ostreatus and 16%using Agaricus Bisporus. For soil 3 decontamination degree using both species had intermediary values.},

	abstract = {Phosphogypsum formed from the production of phosphoric acid represents by far the biggest accumulation of gypsum-rich wastes in the world and commonly contains elevated radionuclides, including uranium, as well as other heavy metals and metalloids. Therefore, billions-of-tons of phosphogypsum stockpiled worldwide not only possess serious environmental problems but also represent a potential uranium resource. Gypsum is also a major solid constituent in many other types of radioactive mine tailings, which stems from the common usage of sulfuric acid in extraction processes. Therefore, management and remediation of radioactive mine tailings as well as future beneficiation of uranium from phosphogysum all require detailed knowledge about the nature and behavior of uranium in gypsum. However, little is known about the uptake mechanism or speciation of uranium in gypsum. In this study, synthesis experiments suggest an apparent pH control on the uptake of uranium in gypsum at ambient conditions: increase in U from 16 μg/g at pH = 6.5 to 339 μg/g at pH = 9.5. Uranium L3-edge synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopic analyses of synthetic gypsum show that uranyl (UO2)2+ at the Ca site is the dominant species. The EXAFS fitting results also indicate that uranyl in synthetic gypsum occurs most likely as carbonate complexes and yields an average U-O distance ∼0.25 Å shorter than the average Ca-O distance, signifying a marked local structural distortion. Applications to phosphogypsum from the New Wales phosphoric acid plant (Florida, USA) and uranium mine tailings from the Key Lake mill (Saskatchewan, Canada) show that gypsum is an important carrier of uranium over a wide range of pH and controls the fate of this radionuclide in mine tailings. Also, development of new technologies for recovering U from phosphogypsum in the future must consider lattice-bound uranyl in gypsum. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The results showed that all radionuclides in soil samples exceeded the soil background value. Through the field investigation, four kinds of dominant plants were identified. It was found that the total quantity of radionuclides in the whole plant from high to low were pokeberry, Cibotium barometz, reed and garden sorrel. We also found that Cibotium barometz had the highest transfer factor (TF) for 238U, garden sorrel had the highest TF for 232Th and reed had the highest TF for 226Ra and 40K. Cibotium barometz had the highest bioconcentration factor (BF) for 238U, 232Th and 226Ra, and pokeberry had the highest BF for 40K. Pokeberry had the highest phytoremediation factor (PF) for 238U, 232Th, 226Ra and 40K.

	abstract = {There are complexity elements to consider when applying subsurface flow and transport models to support environmental analyses. Modelers balance the benefits and costs of modeling along the spectrum of complexity, taking into account the attributes of more simple models (e.g., lower cost, faster execution, easier to explain, less mechanistic) and the attributes of more complex models (higher cost, slower execution, harder to explain, more mechanistic and technically defensible). In this report, modeling complexity is examined with respect to considering this balance. The discussion of modeling complexity is organized into three primary elements: (1) modeling approach, (2) description of process, and (3) description of heterogeneity. Three examples are used to examine these complexity elements. Two of the examples use simulations generated from a complex model to develop simpler models for efficient use in model applications. The first example is designed to support performance evaluation of soil-vapor-extraction remediation in terms of groundwater protection. The second example investigates the importance of simulating different categories of geochemical reactions for carbon sequestration and selecting appropriate simplifications for use in evaluating sequestration scenarios. In the third example, the modeling history for a uranium-contaminated site demonstrates that conservative parameter estimates were inadequate surrogates for complex, critical processes and there is discussion on the selection of more appropriate model complexity for this application. All three examples highlight how complexity considerations are essential to create scientifically defensible models that achieve a balance between model simplification and complexity. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {The present study highlights the uranium (U) concentrations in water–soil–plant matrices and the efficiency considering a heterogeneous assemblage of terrestrial and aquatic native plant species to act as the biomonitor and phytoremediator for environmental U-contamination in the Sevilha mine (uraniferous region of Beiras, Central Portugal). A total of 53 plant species belonging to 22 families was collected from 24 study sites along with ambient soil and/or water samples. The concentration of U showed wide range of variations in the ambient medium: 7.5 to 557 mg kg− 1 for soil and 0.4 to 113 μg L− 1 for water. The maximum potential of U accumulation was recorded in roots of the following terrestrial plants: Juncus squarrosus (450 mg kg− 1 DW), Carlina corymbosa (181 mg kg− 1 DW) and Juncus bufonius (39.9 mg kg− 1 DW), followed by the aquatic macrophytes, namely Callitriche stagnalis (55.6 mg kg− 1 DW) Lemna minor (53.0 mg kg− 1 DW) and Riccia fluitans (50.6 mg kg− 1 DW). Accumulation of U in plant tissues exhibited the following decreasing trend: root > leaves > stem > flowers/fruits and this confirms the unique efficiency of roots in accumulating this radionuclide from host soil/sediment (phytostabilization). Overall, the accumulation pattern in the studied aquatic plants (L. minor, R. fluitans, C. stagnalis and Lythrum portula) dominated over most of the terrestrial counterpart. Among terrestrial plants, the higher mean bioconcentration factor (≈ 1 in roots/rhizomes of C. corymbosa and J. squarrosus) and translocation factor (31 in Andryala integrifolia) were encountered in the representing families Asteraceae and Juncaceae. Hence, these terrestrial plants can be treated as the promising candidates for the development of the phytostabilization or phytoextraction methodologies based on the accumulation, abundance and biomass production. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

The work has been undertaken with the following objectives: (i) to relate the U concentrations in water-sediment-plant system; and (ii) to identify the potentialities of aquatic plants to remediate U-contaminated waters based on accumulation pattern. A total of 25 plant species culminating 233 samples was collected from 15 study points along with surface water and contiguous sediments. Concentrations of U showed wide range of variations both in waters (0.61-5.56 μg L-1, mean value 1.98 μg L-1) and sediments (124-23,910 μg kg-1, mean value 3929 μg kg-1) and this is also reflected in plant species examined. The plant species exhibited the ability to accumulate U several orders of magnitude higher than the surrounding water. Maximum U concentrations was recorded in the bryophyte Scorpiurium deflexifolium (49,639 μg kg-1) followed by Fontinalis antipyretica (35,771 μg kg-1), shoots of Rorippa sylvestris (33,837 μg kg-1), roots of Oenanthe crocata (17,807 μg kg-1) as well as in Nasturtium officinale (10,995 μg kg-1). Scorpiurium deflexifolium displayed a high bioconcentration factor (BF) of ~2.5 × 104 (mean value). The species Fontinalis antipyretica, Nasturtium officinale (roots) and Rorippa sylvestris (shoots) exhibited the mean BFs of 1.7 × 104, 5 × 103 and 4.8 × 103 respectively. Maximum translocation factor (TF) was very much pronounced in the rooted perennial herb Rorippa sylvestris showing extreme ability to transport U for the shoots and seems to be promising candidate to be used as bioindicator species. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

Overcoming this issue requires using effective methods to minimize the availability of uranium and other metals in soils. Jordan has a promising project for electricity generation from nuclear power. To move forward with this nuclear project, the Jordan Central Area has been mined for uranium. The expansion of the mining activities in this area led to elevated contents of heavy metal in the surface soil. Phytoremediation efficiency in reducing uranium content from uraniumrich carbonate soil was tested using sunflower plants. Forty-eight sunflower plants were planted in three soil samples containing three different uranium concentrations. The plants were harvested after different planting periods in order to investigate the phytoremediation efficiency over time. The ability of sunflowers to translocate uranium was investigated and the results showed that the translocated amount of uranium to plant increased as the initial concentration of uranium in the soil increased. However, most of the uranium taken up by the sunflower was accumulated in the roots, and only 3% of the uranium concentration in the roots passed to the harvestable shoots. Moreover, the biomass of the plants was not affected by increasing uranium concentration in the plants indicating that sunflower is resistant to radiation and toxicity of uranium at these levels found in the soil. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.},

	abstract = {The existing decontamination method using electrokinetic equipment after acidic washing for uranium-contaminated soil requires a long decontamination time and a significant amount of electric power. However, after soil washing, with a sulfuric acid solution and an oxidant at 65 °C, the removal of the muddy solution using a 100 mesh sieve can decrease the radioactivity of the remaining coarse soil to the clearance level. Therefore, only a small amount of fine soil collected from the muddy solution requires the electrokinetic process for its decontamination. Furthermore, it is found that the selective removal of uranium from the sulfuric washing solution is not obtained using an anion exchanger but rather using a cation exchanger, unexpectedly. More than 90% of the uranium in the soil washing solutions is adsorbed on the S-950 resin, and 87% of the uranium adsorbed on S-950 is desorbed by washing with a 0.5 M Na2CO3 solution at 60 °C. © 2016},

The dry biomass was markedly high in Gv than that in CK, especially in roots. The total U was significantly higher in Gv than that in CK, and was fixed predominantly into roots. The media in Gv showed less U than that in CK. It was absorbed the most to iron and manganese oxidable U and sulfide U, and each U species declined accompanying the time prolongation. In addition, bioconcentration factors were higher in Gv compared to those of CK, and both treatments were above 1. Positive relationship was found between mycorrhizal colonization and bioconcentration factors. Therefore, U uptake was enhanced inoculated by Gv, and the symbiont in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus and Pteris vittata L. had a potential to remediate U polluted soil. ©, 2015, Huanjing Kexue/Environmental Science.

	abstract = {Application of radioactive elements or radionuclides for anthropogenic use is a widespread phenomenon nowadays. Radionuclides undergo radioactive decays releasing ionizing radiation like gamma ray(s) and/or alpha or beta particles that can displace electrons in the living matter (like in DNA) and disturb its function. Radionuclides are highly hazardous pollutants of considerable impact on the environment, food chain and human health. Cleaning up of the contaminated environment through plants is a promising technology where the rhizosphere may play an important role. Plants belonging to the families of Brassicaceae, Papilionaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Poaceae, and Asteraceae are most important in this respect and offer the largest potential for heavy metal phytoremediation. Plants like Lactuca sativa L., Silybum marianum Gaertn., Centaurea cyanus L., Carthamus tinctorius L., Helianthus annuus and H. tuberosus are also important plants for heavy metal phytoremediation. However, transfer factors (TF) of radionuclide from soil/water to plant ([Radionuclide]plant/[Radionuclide]soil) vary widely in different plants. Rhizosphere, rhizobacteria and varied metal transporters like NRAMP, ZIP families CDF, ATPases (HMAs) family like P1B-ATPases, are involved in the radio-phytoremediation processes. This review will discuss recent advancements and potential application of plants for radionuclide removal from the environment. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

For this purpose, an experiment was carried out, in which columns filled with sandy and clay Brazilian typical soils mixed with phosphogypsum were percolated with water, to achieve a mild extraction of these elements. The results obtained for the concentration of the radionuclides and metals in the leachate were low; giving evidence that, even when these elements are present in the phosphogypsum, they do not contribute to an enhancement of their content in water. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

We used both (a) mycorrhiza with Rhizophagus irregularis and (b) bacterial amendments with Streptomyces acidiscabies E13 and Streptomyces tendae F4 to mediate plant-promoting and metal-accumulating properties to Sorghum bicolor. In pot experiments, the effects on plant growth and metal uptake were scored, and in a field trial at a former uranium leaching heap site near Ronneburg, Germany, we could show the efficacy under field conditions. Different metals could be extracted at the same time, with varying microbial inoculation and soil amendment scenarios possible when a certain metal is the focus of interest. Especially, manganese was extracted at very high levels which might be useful even for phytomining approaches. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Although uranium (U) is naturally found in the environment, soil remediation programs will become increasingly important in light of certain human activities. This work aimed to identify U(VI) detoxification mechanisms employed by a bacteria strain isolated from a Chernobyl soil sample, and to distinguish its active from passive mechanisms of interaction. The ability of the Microbacterium sp. A9 strain to remove U(VI) from aqueous solutions at 4. °C and 25. °C was evaluated, as well as its survival capacity upon U(VI) exposure. The subcellular localisation of U was determined by TEM/EDX microscopy, while functional groups involved in the interaction with U were further evaluated by FTIR; finally, the speciation of U was analysed by TRLFS. We have revealed, for the first time, an active mechanism promoting metal efflux from the cells, during the early steps following U(VI) exposure at 25. °C. The Microbacterium sp. A9 strain also stores U intracellularly, as needle-like structures that have been identified as an autunite group mineral. Taken together, our results demonstrate that this strain exhibits a high U(VI) tolerance based on multiple detoxification mechanisms. These findings support the potential role of the genus Microbacterium in the remediation of aqueous environments contaminated with U(VI) under aerobic conditions. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Approximately 60% of total uranium at an initial concentration of 10 mg/L uranium nitrate solution could be absorbed on 100 mg S. sporoverrucosus dwc-3 with an adsorption capacity of more than 3.0 mg/g (wet weight) after 12 hr at room temperature at pH 3.0. The dynamic biosorption process of S. sporoverrucosus dwc-3 for uranyl ions was well described by a pseudo second-order model. S. sporoverrucosus dwc-3 could accumulate uranium on cell walls and within the cell, as revealed by SEM and TEM analysis as well as EDX spectra. XPS and FT-IR analysis further suggested that the absorbed uranium was bound to amino, phosphate and carboxyl groups of the cells. Additionally, PIXE and EPBS results confirmed that ion exchange also contributed to the adsorption process of uranium. © 2015.},

	abstract = {One of the largest and most important near-surface deposits of uranium in Portugal is found in the region of Nisa. Unexploited resources in the Nisa deposit are estimated at about 32 million tonnes of ore. To better understand the processes of natural dispersion of chemicals, such as hydrogravitational erosion and reactive transport, samples of soils and of stream sediments were collected in the vicinity of the Nisa deposit and analysed for chemical signatures of metals (uranium, chromium, molybdenum, niobium, vanadium, and zinc) and semi-metals (arsenic). Stream sediment samples were taken from sites along a 470-m-long stretch of a river bed near the mineralization, with soil samples being collected from riverbanks. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate statistical analysis as well as GIS mapping tools were used to identify and interpret variations in geochemical concentrations of the different elements and the relationships between them. The analyses allowed local background (reference) values to be established with respect to the geochemical anomaly caused by the mineral deposit. These background values were compared with legislation standards established for the remediation of soils and sediments. Recommendations to be considered in land-use planning with respect to the occurrence of natural geochemical anomalies are presented.},

	abstract = {The mining complex of Murçós belongs to the Terras de Cavaleiros Geopark, located in Trás-os-Montes region, northeast Portugal. A stockwork of NW-SE-trending W>Sn quartz veins intruded Silurian metamorphic rocks and a Variscan biotite granite. The mineralized veins contain mainly quartz, cassiterite, wolframite, scheelite, arsenopyrite, pyrite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, galena, rare pyrrhotite, stannite, native bismuth and also later bismuthinite, matildite, joseite, roosveltite, anglesite, scorodite, zavaritskite and covellite. The exploitation produced 335t of a concentrate with 70% of W and 150t of another concentrate with 70% of Sn between 1948 and 1976. The exploitation took place mainly in four open pit mines as well as underground. Three lakes were left in the area. Remediation processes of confination and control of tailings and rejected materials and phytoremediation with macrophytes from three lakes were carried out between 2005 and 2007. Stream sediments, soils and water samples were collected in 2008 and 2009, after the remediation process. Most stream sediments showed deficiency or minimum enrichment for metals. The sequential enrichment factor in stream sediments W>Bi>As>U>Cd>Sn=Ag>Cu>Sb>Pb>Be>Zn is mainly associated with the W>Sn mineralizations. Stream sediments receiving drainage of a mine dump were found to be significantly to extremely enriched with W, while stream sediments and soils were found to be contaminated with As. Two soil samples collected around mine dumps and an open pit lake were also found to be contaminated with U. The waters from the Murçós W>Sn mine area were acidic to neutral. After the remediation, the surface waters were contaminated with F−, Al, As, Mn and Ni and must not be used for human consumption, while open pit lake waters must also not be used for agriculture because of contamination with F−, Al, Mn and Ni. In most waters, the As occurred as As (III), which is toxic and is easily mobilized in the drainage system. The remediation promoted a decrease in metals and As concentrations of soils and waters, however the applied processes were not enough to rehabilitate the area. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

It is known that the degree of adoption of U depends on the plant species and its morphological and physiological properties, but it is less known what impact have plants cultivars, sorts, and hybrids. Therefore, we investigated the U adoption in four cultivars of three plant species (corn, sunflower and soy bean). “Vegetation experiments were carried out in a plastic-house filled with soil (0.66 mgU) and with tailing (15.3 mgU kg−1) from closed uranium mine Gabrovnica-Kalna southeast of Serbia”. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Cluster Analysis (CA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for assessing the effect of different substrates cultivars, plant species and plant organs (root or shoot) on U uptake. Obtained results showed that a difference in U uptake by three investigated plant species depends not only of the type of substrate types and plant organs but also of their cultivars. Biometrics techniques provide a good opportunity for a better understanding the behavior of plants and obtaining much more useful information from the original data. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {The effect of calcium-uranyl-carbonate complex on the adsorption of uranium on red soil was investigated through static adsorption experiment. The results indicate that the increases of pH and concentrations of dissolved carbonate and calcium ion can suppress U(VI) adsorption on red soil. When pH is 7.0, dosage of red soil is 1 g/L and concentrations of calcium ion, dissolved carbonate and uranium are 0.4 mmol/L, 3.8 mmol/L and 50 mg/L respectively, the maximum adsorption capacity is about 4.20 mg/g. The uranium is mainly adsorbed in the forms of UO2(CO3)22-, UO2(CO3)34- and UO2CO3(aq). The c(U-CO3)T can be used to predict uranium adsorption capacity of red soil. The c(U-CO3)T has a nonlinear relationship with qe, and the equation is qe=18.2(c(UO22+)c(CO32-)(K1+K2c(CO32-)+K3c2(CO32-))0.36.

These include copper, iron, gold and several others. Although modern mining companies have sustainable mining programs that include tailings management and external verifications, it is recognized that these industrial activities are responsible for a significant damage to the environment. Specially, technologies such as smelting and roasting generate very toxic emissions, including solid particles in the air, very large tailings and contribute to generate acid mine drainage (AMD) that affects humans health and all kinds of living plants, animals and microorganisms. Consequently, due to environmental restrictions, these methods are being replaced in many countries by less contaminating processes. On the other hand, the microbial solubilization of metals by bioleaching or biomining is successfully used in industrial operations, to extract several metals such as copper, gold and uranium. © 2017 The Author.

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the uptake of 238U, 235U, 232Th, 226Ra, 210Pb and 40K by plants that grow on a coal ash and slag disposal site known for its higher content of naturally occurring radionuclides. Plant species that were sampled are common for the Mediterranean flora and can be divided as follows: grasses & herbs, shrubs and trees. To compare the activity concentrations and the resultant concentration ratios of the disposal site with those in natural conditions, we used control data specific for the research area, obtained for plants growing on untreated natural soil. Radionuclide activity concentrations were determined by high resolution gamma-ray spectrometry. Media parameters (pH, electrical conductivity and organic matter content) were also analysed. We confirmed significantly higher activity concentrations of 238U, 235U, 226Ra and 210Pb in ash and slag compared to control soil. However, a significant increase in the radionuclide activity concentration in the disposal site's vegetation was observed only for 226Ra. On the contrary, a significantly smaller activity concentration of 40K in ash and slag had no impact on its activity concentration in plant samples. The calculated plant uptake of 238U, 235U, 226Ra and 210Pb is significantly smaller in comparison with the uptake at the control site, while it is vice versa for 40K. No significant difference was observed between the disposal site and the control site's plant uptake of 232Th. These results can be the foundation for further radioecological assessment of this disposal site but also, globally, they can contribute to a better understanding of nature and long-term management of such disposal sites. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Organic acids are important metal chelators in environmental systems and tend to form soluble complexes in aqueous solutions, ultimately influencing the transport and bioavailability of contaminants in surface and subsurface waters. This is particularly true for the formation of uranyl citrate complexes, which have been utilized in advanced photo- and bioremediation strategies for soils contaminated with nuclear materials. Given the complexity of environmental systems, the formation of ternary or heterometallic uranyl species in aqueous solutions are also expected, particularly with Al(iii) and Fe(iii) cations. These ternary forms are reported to be more stable in aqueous solutions, potentially enhancing contaminant mobility and uptake by organisms, but the exact coordination geometries of these soluble molecular complexes have not been elucidated. To provide insight into the nature of these species, we have developed a series of geochemical model compounds ([(UO2)2Al2(C6H4O7)4]6- (U2Al2), [(UO2)2Fe2(C6H4O7)4]6- (U2Fe2-1) and [(UO2)2Fe2(C6H4O7)4(H2O)2]6- (U2Fe2-2) and [(UO2)2Fe4(OH)4(C6H4O7)4]8- (U2Fe4)) that were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and vibrational spectroscopy. Mass spectroscopy was then employed to compare the model compounds to species present in aqueous solutions to provide an enhanced understanding of the ternary uranyl citrate complexes that could be relevant in natural systems. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.},

In the current study, the potential of bacterial endophytes in partnership with Leptochloa fusca (L.) Kunth was evaluated for the remediation of uranium (U)- and lead (Pb)-contaminated soil. L. fusca was vegetated in contaminated soil and inoculated with three different endophytic bacterial strains, Pantoea stewartii ASI11, Enterobacter sp. HU38, and Microbacterium arborescens HU33, individually as well as in combination. The results showed that the L. fusca can grow in the contaminated soil. Bacterial inoculation improved plant growth and phytoremediation capacity: this manifested in the form of a 22–51% increase in root length, 25–62% increase in shoot height, 10–21% increase in chlorophyll content, and 17–59% more plant biomass in U- and Pb-contaminated soils as compared to plants without bacterial inoculation. Although L. fusca plants showed potential to accumulate U and Pb in their root and shoot on their own, bacterial consortia further enhanced metal uptake capacity by 53–88% for U and 58–97% for Pb. Our results indicate that the combination of L. fusca and endophytic bacterial consortia can effectively be used for the phytostabilization of both U- and Pb-contaminated soils. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The microbial reduction of uranium is studied as a strategy for rehabilitation of uranium-containing groundwater. The bioremediation mechanism converts dissolved uranium(VI) into low-solubility U(IV). The processes involving dissimilatory reducing bacteria, which facilitate the reduction and retention of U(VI) in soils and rocks, are considered. The diversity of microorganisms involved in anaerobic reduction of uranium is shown. The geochemical conditions that may affect the rate of microbial reduction of U(VI) are specified, i.e., the presence of nitrate ions, phosphate ions, calcium ions, and iron oxides. The mechanisms of their action are examined. Geochemical barriers with the participation of microorganisms are proposed for the rehabilitation of groundwater with uranium removed from groundwater and deposited locally as a result of microbial reduction of U(VI). © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

	abstract = {We combined phytoremediation and soil microbial nitrification and denitrification cycles to reduce nitrate and ammonium levels at a former uranium mill site near Monument Valley, Arizona. Ammonia used in uraxnium extraction was present throughout the soil profile. Sulfate, applied as sulfuric acid to solubilize uranium, was also present in the soil. These contaminants were leaching from a denuded area where a tailings pile had been removed and were migrating away from the site in groundwater. We planted the source area with two deep-rooted native shrubs, Atriplex cansescens and Sarcobatus vermiculatus, and irrigated transplants for 11 years at 20% the rate of potential evapotranspiration to stimulate growth, then discontinued irrigation for 4 years. Over 15 years, total nitrogen levels dropped 82%, from 347 to 64 mg kg−1. Analysis of δ15N supported our hypothesis that coupled microbial nitrification and denitrification processes were responsible for the loss of N. Soil sulfate levels changed little; however, evapotranspiration reduced sulfate leaching into the aquifer. For arid sites where traditional pump-and-treat methods are problematic, the Monument Valley data suggest that alternatives that incorporate native plants and rely on vadose zone biogeochemistry and hydrology could be a sustainable remediation for nitrogen contaminated soil.

	abstract = {During the latter part of the twentieth century, the United States developed a highly technical nuclear weapons complex that involved workers at many facilities performing complex missions at a number of different industrial sites across the country. Now, many of these sites are being remediated to remove legacy materials including chemical and radioactive wastes. Along with remediation comes the responsibility to adequately assess risk to cleanup workers who could be exposed to any hazardous materials, including resuspended uranium dust, encountered during environmental restoration. Inhalation of resuspended uranium represents one of the exposure hazards at an abandoned former metal rolling mill where approximately 11 thousand tons of uranium metal was rolled between 1947 and 1958. Residual uranium contamination in the dirt floor of this abandoned site has been exposed to rain, ice, snow, and other environmental factors for more than 50 y. This report describes the solubility of the uranium contamination in this dirt measured in vitro using a modified recipe for simulated lung fluid that contains a pulmonary surfactant. Small (0.1 g) aliquots of dirt collected at this site were sequentially dissolved in simulated lung fluid for increasing periods of time up to 30 d. Solubility was classified according to the ICRP categories as fast, medium, and slow. Results demonstrate that the solubility designation for the uranium contamination in the dirt is approximately 50% fast, 15% medium, and 35-40% slow. There was no observed difference in solubility when a pulmonary surfactant was added to the simulated lung fluid. © 2015 Health Physics Society.},

	abstract = {Background: The global industrialization is fulfilling the demands of modern population at the cost of environmental exposure to various contaminants including heavy metals. These heavy metals affect water and soil quality. Moreover, these enter into the food chain and exhibit their lethal effects on the human health even when present at slightly higher concentration than required for normal metabolism. To the worst of their part, the heavy metals may become carcinogenic. Henceforth, the efficient removal of heavy metals is the demand of sustainable development. Remedy: Bioremediation is the ‘green’ imperative technique for the heavy metal removal without creating secondary metabolites in the ecosystem. The metabolic potential of several bacterial, algal, fungal as well as plant species has the efficiency to exterminate the heavy metals from the contaminated sites. Different strategies like bioaccumulation, biosorption, biotransformation, rhizofilteration, bioextraction and volatilization are employed for removal of heavy metals by the biological species. Bioremediation approach is presenting a splendid alternate for conventional expensive and inefficient methods for the heavy metal removal. Conclusion: The patents granted on the bioremediation of toxic heavy metals are summarized in the present manuscript which supported the applicability of bioremediation technique at commercial scale. However, the implementation of the present information and advanced research are mandatory to further explore the concealed potential of biological species to resume the originality of the environment. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.},

	abstract = {Polyvalent trace elements such as the high field strength elements (HFSE) are commonly considered rather immobile during low-temperature water-rock interaction. Hence, they have become diagnostic tools that are widely applied in geochemical studies. We present results of batch leaching experiments focused on the mobilization of certain HFSE (Y, Zr, Hf, Th, U and rare earth elements) from mafic, intermediate and felsic igneous rocks in the presence and absence, respectively, of the siderophore desferrioxamine B (DFOB). Our data show that DFOB strongly enhances the mobility of these trace elements during low-temperature water-rock interaction.The presence of DFOB produces two distinct features in the Rare Earths and Yttrium (REY) patterns of leaching solutions, regardless of the mineralogical and chemical composition or the texture of the rock type studied. Bulk rock-normalized REY patterns of leaching solutions with DFOB show (i) a very distinct positive Ce anomaly and (ii) depletion of La and other light REY relative to the middle REY, with a concave downward pattern between La and Sm. These features are not observed in experiments with hydrochloric acid, acetic acid or deionized water. In DFOB-bearing leaching solutions Ce and U are decoupled from and selectively enriched relative to light REY and Th, respectively, due to oxidation to Ce(IV) and U(VI). Oxidation of Ce3+ and U4+ is promoted by the significantly higher stability of the Ce(IV) and U(VI) DFOB complexes as compared to the Ce(III) and U(IV) DFOB complexes. This is similar to the relationship between the Ce(IV)- and Ce(III)-pentacarbonate complexes that cause positive Ce anomalies in alkaline lakes. However, while formation of Ce(IV) carbonate complexes is confined to alkaline environments, Ce(IV) DFOB complexes may produce positive Ce anomalies even in mildly acidic and near-neutral natural waters. Siderophore-promoted dissolution processes also significantly enhance mobility of other 'immobile' HFSE and may not only cause or modify Ce anomalies and Th-U fractionation, but also mobilization of and fractionation between Zr, Hf, Th and redox-insensitive REY during weathering, pedogenesis, diagenesis and incongruent dissolution of particles in seawater and freshwater.Siderophores may significantly affect the use of HFSE as geochemical tools. Concave downward light REY patterns may be used as a biosignature for water-rock interaction in the presence of siderophores. Enhanced and preferential mobilization of U relative to Th in the presence of siderophores may produce Th-U signals comparable to those indicative of weathering under oxidized conditions, which might constrain the use of U concentrations and Th/U ratios as a paleoredox-proxy. The enhanced mobilization of Zr and especially Hf from igneous rocks in the presence of DFOB might have implications for the use of the latter as a tracer for the impact of continental weathering on seawater chemistry. Because siderophore complexes affect the particle-reactivity of Hf and Zr, they may prevent effective removal of terrigenous Hf and Zr during aggregation/coagulation of riverine particles in estuaries. Siderophore-promoted solubilization and stabilization might hence be an additional way to transport continental Hf and Zr to the oceans. Furthermore, siderophore-enhanced mobilization may also have implications for the remediation techniques employed to immobilize HFSE such as U, Th and REY, at nuclear waste and reprocessing sites and at REY ore processing plants, where soils are commonly contaminated with these (sometimes radioactive) heavy metals. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

The recently-identified Acidimicrobiaceae bacterium A6 (ATCC, PTA-122488) derives energy from ammonium oxidation coupled with Fe reduction. This bacterium has been found in various soil and wetland environments, including U-contaminated wetland sediments. Incubations of Acidimicrobiaceae bacteria A6 with nontronite, an Fe(III)-rich clay, and approximately 10 µM U indicate that these bacteria can use U(VI) in addition to Fe(III) as an electron acceptor in the presence of ammonium. Measurements of Fe(II) production and ammonium oxidation support this interpretation. Concentrations of approximately 100 µM U were found to entirely inhibit Acidimicrobiaceae bacteria A6 activity. These results suggest that natural sites of active ammonium oxidation under Fe reducing conditions by Acidimicrobiaceae bacteria A6 could be hotspots of U immobilization by bioreduction.

The scaling factors can be used to estimate doses from bush foods once the post-remediation radiological conditions of the mine and surrounding environment are known. © 2017},

	abstract = {Rice, a staple food for over half of the world's population, represents a significant dietary source of inorganic arsenic. Thus, it is of great importance to reduce the levels of inorganic arsenic in rice with minimal cost and efficiency. Based on this, the present study focused on the isolation and identification of fungi present in soil rhizosphere to be used as a low-cost and environmentally-friendly procedure for inorganic arsenic remediation. Soil samples, from rice production areas, were evaluated in matter of toxic and essential elements (Pb, Cd, Ni, Mn, Se, Co, Cr, Ba, Rb, U, Cs, V, Cu, Fe, Mg, Zn) by inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The isolated and identified filamentous fungi were Penicillium sp., Aspergillus sp., Trichoderma sp., Cladosporium sp., Rhizopus sp. and Westerdykella sp. Fungi were submitted to As3+ exposure in Czapeck growth media, and the biomass and broth of each fungus were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to ICP-MS. The results have shown capacity of arsenic biotransformation and accumulation. Arsenic-tolerance test (0-50 mg l-1 As3+) has shown that the most arsenic-tolerant genera were Penicillium sp. and Aspergillus sp. Our data led us to believe that filamentous fungi may influence on arsenic biogeochemistry in rice paddy soils and further these microorganisms might be potentially used for bioremediation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The Paukkajanvaara mine in Eno, eastern Finland, started to operate in 1959. The mine was a test site for assessing the feasibility of larger-scale uranium extraction. Pilot-scale mining and milling were carried out between 1958 and 1961, and the mine site was rehabilitated in the early 1990s. The aim of this study was to examine the potential for further mobilization of radionuclides after remediation. There are two primary sources of contamination at the site, the waste-rock pile and the tailings. Our study indicates that 226Ra leached from the waste-rock pile and accumulated in surrounding soil. In run-off sediment samples collected from a dry stream bed near the waste-rock pile, the activity concentrations of 226Ra and 238U were higher than in soil samples. From the tailings, radionuclides can leach directly to the lake and to another small stream, which flows to the east of the waste-rock pile. In the water samples collected from this stream, uranium concentrations increased at the outlet to the lake. The results from the soil samples collected between the tailings area and the stream indicate leaching of 238U and 226Ra with the surface flow. Sediment samples collected from the bottom of the lake displayed pronounced uranium series disequilibrium with fractionations of 210Pb and 226Ra relative to the parent 238U. The results therefore indicate that leaching and accumulation of at least 226Ra from the waste-rock pile and possibly tailings is still ongoing. © 2016.},

The present study focused on demonstrating whether low concentration of U treatment in liquid nutient medium may translocate traces of U in plants and in fruits of Pisum sativum after 30 and 60 days of exposure for the safe use as a food supplement for human/animals. Hydroponically grown plants (in amended Hoagland medium) were treated with two different concentrations of uranium ([U] = 100 and 500 nM, respectively). Plants showed a decrease in total chlorophyll after 60 days of treatment. On the other hand, Eh of the nutrient medium was not affected from the initial days till 60 days of treatment, but pH of nutrient medium was increased upon durations, highest at 60 days of treatment. In seeds, micro/macro elements were under limit as well as U concentration was also under detection limit. We did not observe any U in the above ground parts (shoots/seeds) of the plant, i.e., under detection limit. Our observation suggests that P. sativum plants may be useful to grow at low radionuclide [U]-contaminated areas for safe human/animal use, but for other fission products, we have to investigate further for the safe human/animal use. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

	abstract = {Savannah River Site (SRS), an approximately 800-km2 former nuclear weapons production facility located near Aiken, SC remains co-contaminated by heavy metals and radionuclides. To gain a better understanding on microbially-mediated bioremediation mechanisms, several bacterial strains resistant to high concentrations of Uranium (U) and Nickel (Ni) were isolated from the Steeds Pond soils located within the SRS site. One of the isolated strains, designated as strain SRS-W-2-2016, grew robustly on both U and Ni. To fully understand the arsenal of metabolic functions possessed by this strain, a draft whole genome sequence (WGS) was obtained, assembled, annotated and analyzed. Genome-centric evaluation revealed the isolate to belong to the Burkholderia genus with close affiliation to B. xenovorans LB400, an aggressive polychlorinated biphenyl-degrader. At a coverage of 90 ×, the genome of strain SRS-W-2-2016 consisted of 8,035,584 bases with a total number of 7071 putative genes assembling into 191 contigs with an N50 contig length of 134,675 bases. Several gene homologues coding for resistance to heavy metals/radionuclides were identified in strain SRS-W-2-2016, such as a suite of outer membrane efflux pump proteins similar to nickel/cobalt transporter regulators, peptide/nickel transport substrate and ATP-binding proteins, permease proteins, and a high-affinity nickel-transport protein. Also noteworthy were two separate gene fragments in strain SRS-W-2-2016 homologous to the spoT gene; recently correlated with bacterial tolerance to U. Additionally, a plethora of oxygenase genes were also identified in the isolate, potentially involved in the breakdown of organic compounds facilitating the strain's successful colonization and survival in the SRS co-contaminated soils. The WGS project of Burkholderia sp. strain SRS-W-2-2016 is available at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession #MSDV00000000. © 2017},

The cumulative frequencies of isolates resistant to each metal tested were as follows: As(V), 74%; Zn, 58%; Ni, 53%; Cd, 47%; Cr(VI), 41%; Co, 40%; Cu, 20%; and Hg, 4%. 16S rRNA gene analysis revealed that isolated bacteria belonged to 14 genera with abundance of Arthrobacter, Microbacterium, Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas. Cobalt did not interfere with the growth of most of the bacterial isolates belonging to different groups while U allowed growth of four different genera of which Stenotrophomonas and Microbacterium showed high U tolerance. Interestingly, tolerance to Ni, Zn, Cu, and Hg was observed only in Microbacterium, Arthrobacter, Paenibacilluş and Acinetobacter, respectively. However, Microbacterium was found to be dominant when isolated from other five different metal enrichments including U. Uranium removal study showed that 84% of the test bacteria could remove more than 50mgUg-1 dry weight from 80 or 160mgL-1 U within 48h. In general, Microbacterium, Arthrobacter and Acinetobacter could remove a higher amount of U. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) study of U exposed cells revealed that accumulated U sequestered mostly around the cell periphery. The study highlights that indigenous U ore deposit bacteria have the potential to interact with U, and thus could be applied for bioremediation of U contaminated sites or wastes. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Stimulating the microbially-mediated precipitation of uranium biominerals may be used to treat groundwater contamination at nuclear sites. The majority of studies to date have focussed on the reductive precipitation of uranium as U(IV) by U(VI)- and Fe(III)-reducing bacteria such as Geobacter and Shewanella species, although other mechanisms of uranium removal from solution can occur, including the precipitation of uranyl phosphates via bacterial phosphatase activity. Here we present the results of uranium biomineralisation experiments using an isolate of Serratia obtained from a sediment sample representative of the Sellafield nuclear site, UK. When supplied with glycerol phosphate, this Serratia strain was able to precipitate 1 mM of soluble U(VI) as uranyl phosphate minerals from the autunite group, under anaerobic and fermentative conditions. Under phosphate-limited anaerobic conditions and with glycerol as the electron donor, non-growing Serratia cells could precipitate 0.5 mM of uranium supplied as soluble U(VI), via reduction to nano-crystalline U(IV) uraninite. Some evidence for the reduction of solid phase uranyl(VI) phosphate was also observed. This study highlights the potential for Serratia and related species to play a role in the bioremediation of uranium contamination, via a range of different metabolic pathways, dependent on culturing or in situ conditions. © 2015 Newsome et al.

Previous studies at the Rifle IFRC have linked microbial processes to uranium immobilization during acetate amendment. Several key bacteria believed to be involved in radionuclide containment have been described; however, most of the evidence implicating uranium reduction with specific microbiota has been indirect. Here, we report on the cultivation of a microorganism from the Rifle IFRC that reduces uranium and appears to utilize it as a terminal electron acceptor for respiration with acetate as electron donor. Furthermore, this bacterium constitutes a significant proportion of the subsurface sediment community prior to biostimulation based on TRFLP profiling of 16S rRNA genes. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicates that the microorganism is a betaproteobacterium with a high similarity to Burkholderia fungorum. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of a betaproteobacterium capable of uranium respiration. Our results indicate that this microorganism occurs commonly in alluvial sediments located between 3-6 m below ground surface at Rifle and may play a role in the initial reduction of uranium at the site. © 2015, Public Library of Science.

Materials and methods: Four zero-suction lysimeters were used in this study. The heavy-metal acidolysis was studied by the soil irrigation with diluted solutions of sulfuric acid or its in situ generation as a result of the bacterial oxidation of S° by Acidithiobacilus thiooxidans. The sulfur requirement was calculated having in mind the higher amount of acid soluble iron in the topsoil due to its contamination by AMD. The combination of acidolysis/complexolysis was studied by cut straw addition to S° at ratio 1:1 and 3:1, respectively. Regular sampling and analyses of the pregnant soil solutions was applied. The pollutant content, their distribution among the geochemical fractions, and the content of amorphous ferric iron hydroxides were determined before and after soil bioremediation. Results and discussion: The reducible mobile fraction was the main fraction in which almost 50 % of each heavy metal was entrapped as a result of the soil pollution by AMD. The combination of acidolysis/complexolysis, realized by elemental sulfur and cut straw addition to horizon A of the AMD-affected soil at ratio of 1:1, allowed the concentration of lead, uranium, and arsenic after 9 months of remediation to be decreased near the relevant maximum admissible concentration (MAC), as their content in the exchangeable and specific adsorbed mobile fraction were drastically reduced. It determined the lower bioavailability of the pollutants at the end of the leaching stage. Conclusions: A mixture of elemental sulfur and cut straw at a ratio of 1:1 was an efficient method for in situ bioremediation of AMD-affected soil. The heavy-metal leaching from easily leachable fractions was a result of the joint action of acidolysis/complexolysis, and as a result, the contaminant content in horizon A was significantly reduced. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Uranium ore waste has led to soil contamination that may affect both environmental and soil health. To analyze the risk of metal transfer, metal bioavailability must be estimated by measuring biological parameters. Kinetic studies allow taking into account the dynamic mechanisms of bioavailability, as well as the steady state concentration in organisms necessary to take into account for relevant risk assessment. In this way, this work aims to model the snail accumulation and excretion kinetics of uranium (U), cesium (Cs) and thorium (Th). Results indicate an absence of Cs and Th accumulation showing the low bioavailability of these two elements and a strong uranium accumulation in snails related to the levels of soil contamination. During the depuration phase, most of the uranium ingested was excreted by the snails. After removing the source of uranium by soil remediation, continued snails excretion of accumulated uranium would lead to the return of their initial internal concentration, thus the potential trophic transfer of this hazardous element would stop. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The uranium processing plant MAPE Mydlovary in South Bohemia, Czech Republic, was in operation for about 30 years, from 1962 until 1991. Extensive remediation and rec lamation work has been done in the area. In the study presented here we measured mass and volume activities of certain radionuclides in soil and water samples from the surroundings and measured gamma equivalent dose rates at the same locations. The average activity concentrations of 40K, 226Ra, and238U in soil were 307.3 ± 4.4 Bq/kg, 133.4 ± 0.8 Bq/kg, and 113.2 ±3.8 Bq/kg, respectively, whereas in water they were 5.7 ± 0.3 Bq/L, 0.30 ± 0.03 Bq/L, and 1.8 ± 0.16 Bq/L, respectively. The gamma equivalent dose rate at 5 cm and 1 m height above ground was 0.15 ± ±.0.04 µSv/h and 0.15 ± 0.03 µSv/h, respectively. As shown by comparison with the findings for similar sites elsewhere in the world, as well as with the results of measurements at uncontaminated locations, these values are compatible with regulation limits and there is no reason for concern regarding the radiation protection for workers involved with further remediation and reclamation, or carrying out other activities in the area. © 2015, Vinca Inst Nuclear Sci.

	abstract = {The financial implications of choosing a particular threshold for clearance of radioactively contaminated land are substantial, particularly when one considers the volume of naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) created each year by the production and combustion of fossil fuels and the exploitation of industrial minerals. Inevitably, a compromise needs to be reached between the level of environmental protection sought and the finite resources available for remediation. In the case of natural series radionuclides, any anthropogenic input is always superimposed on the inventory already present in the soil; this 'background' inventory is conventionally disregarded when assessing remediation targets. Unfortunately, the term is not well defined and the concept of 'background dose' is open to alternative interpretations. In this paper, we address the issue of natural background from a geochemical rather than from a solely radiological perspective, illustrating this with an example from the china clay industry. We propose a simple procedure for decision making based on activity concentrations of primordial radionuclides and their progeny. Subsequent calculations of dose need to take into account the mineralogical and chemical characteristics of the contamination, which in the case of NORM are invariably reflected in uranium series disequilibrium. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Uranium is known for its toxicity and has been a nuclear hazard. Its radioactive nature has made it a cause of lung and bone cancer. The uranium content in water bodies in several countries has surpassed the maximum permissible limits. In such regions of radioactive contamination of local soil and groundwater, the chemical toxicity of uranium has tremendously aggravated health concerns. Large scale loss of aquatic species has been witnessed due to uranium contamination. Governments have imposed regulations and set standards to limit the disposal of uranium in water bodies. Owing to its ability of fission, uranium simultaneously finds its application is nuclear energy generation. It is also used as a shield against radiation, as ammunition in military weaponry, as a counterweight for aircraft control surfaces, in radiotherapy and on-stream analysis of a wide range of minerals. With an objective to advance the understanding, this article covers the various techniques for the recovery of uranium along with a wide range of removal agents, considering the various factors that affect uranium uptake. The techniques contemplated upon include adsorption, membrane filtration, phytoremediation, reductive precipitation, microbiological methods and bio-precipitation. The isotherm and kinetic models used in adsorption have been stated and a comparative evaluation of the above listed techniques has also been done. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The contamination of significant quantities of soils and sediments with uranium and other actinide elements as a result of nuclear activity poses many environmental risks. The electrokinetic process is one of the most promising remediation techniques for sludge, sediment, and saturated or unsaturated soils contaminated with heavy metals and radionuclides. However, secondary waste is a major concern for soil contaminated with nuclides. To minimize the generation of secondary wastes, this study used the anion and cation exchange membranes to improve the performance of the experimental apparatus. Remediation experiments of uranium-contaminated soil were performed with different agents. The results show that using acetic acid and EDTA as chelating agents clearly enhances the migration ability of the uranium. The ion exchange membranes (IEMs) used in the experiments not only reduce secondary wastes, but also, keep the soil pH stable. Copyright © 2015 by JSME.},

	abstract = {Chromium (Cr) may cause losses in the yield of field plant, which is one of the favorite habitats of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). The purposes of our study were to assess the Cr(VI)-resistance and Cr(VI)-reducing abilities of an indigenous soil isolate of Bt and to determine the factors governing Cr(VI) reduction. Towards this end a novel dichromate-reducing Bt BRC-ZYR2, characterized with insecticidal crystal proteins (ICPs), was isolated from a uranium deposit. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of Cr(VI) were determined by broth dilution method and the concentrations of Cr(VI) and total Cr in the supernatant were quantified colorimetrically using 1,5-diphenylcarbazide (DPC) reagent and a mixture of sulfuric-nitric acids, respectively. The isolate contained five ICP genes (cry1Ba, cry1Bb, cry1Be/cry1Bf, cry9Ca and cry9Da) and exhibited a high level of Cr(VI) resistance with MICs of 150 mg L-1 at pH 7.0 and 30 °C, and 500 mg L-1 under optimal conditions (pH 9.0 and 40 °C). The total Cr concentration was similar to initial concentration of Cr(VI) under the optimal condition, suggesting that the essential removal of the Cr(VI) was dependent on Bt reduction. Under optimal conditions, the initial Cr(VI) concentrations from 25 to 75 mg L-1 significantly decreased in 24 h after incubation. Addition of Mn2+, Co2+, Mo2+ and Cu2+ activated Bt-mediated Cr(VI) reduction, while Zn2+, Ni2+ and glucose were found to inhibit the reduction. Our results indicated that this isolate could be a promising biopesticide with the potential for both insect biocontrol and Cr bioremediation in the field. © 2014 Soil Science Society of China.},

	abstract = {Soil contamination with metals is a serious problem requiring urgent measures to counteract their impacts. The conventional soil remediation techniques are often inefficient and expensive. In this work, we studied the potential of the species Fraxinus angustifolia for the phytoremediation of metal contaminated soils from the Cunha Baixa uranium mine (Mangualde, Portugal). The plants were exposed to a contaminated, a reference and a control soil, for a period of about 3months, during which metal accumulation and a set of physiologic parameters (shoot height, potential maximum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) and quantum yield of PSII (ΦPSII), leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf relative water content, leaf chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoid content, leaf malondialdehyde (MDA) content and leaf proline content) were measured. The genetic profiles of the endophytic communities from the roots of the plants were also analyzed, via PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) targeted for a conserved region of 16S rDNA, pre- and post-exposure. Only the shoot height was a suitable indicator of the negative effects of the contamination with metals on the plants. The remaining parameters indicated good physiologic fitness and recovery. The trees did not hyperaccumulate metals but extracted Sr at a higher rate. The bacterial profiles from the control and reference soils showed more similarity with each other and with the pre-exposure profiles than with those from the contaminated soil. We showed that F. angustifolia has the ability to resist and adapt to the adverse conditions of contamination, revealing a potential which can be exploited for phytoremediation, specifically phytostabilization. It also revealed that changes exerted on the bacterial root communities exposed to contamination, resulted in profiles considerably different from those of the remaining communities. © 2013.},

The nuclear facilities were widely distributed in coastal areas or remote mountainous areas. With the rapid development of the nuclear industry, nuclear fuel cycle system, such as uranium mining and milling, component manufacturing, transportation and disposal of spent fuel, radioactive waste disposal, also would be large-scale distributed, so it is no doubt that the environmental impact would become increasingly prominent and severe. Radionuclides contaminate the environment through the gas, liquid and solid around nuclear facilities, and in case of radioactive leakage, the contamination would affect the soil and public health through food chain.

	abstract = {With the widespread use of nuclear power, soil contamination by nuclear waste is causing increasing concerns around the world. Traditional technologies for soil remediation, such as geomelting, have limited uses due to high cost of energy. More sustainable solutions such as electrokinetic remediation using low direct current, within this context, are gaining more popularity for cleaning up contaminated soils. In this paper, a mathematical model was developed to evaluate the technique of electrokinetic remediation as a potential strategy for removing nuclear waste from variably saturated soils. Multiple species-driven mechanisms were coupled in one governing partial differential equation of high nonlinearity, which was then solved using the finite element method (FEM). The binding effect between transporting species and soil matrix was taken into account in the FEM model based on Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The numerical model was validated experimentally and then applied to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of electrokinetically removing a typical radioactive species from nuclear waste, uranium dioxide ions (UO2 2+). According to the predicted results, a soil sample at the dimensions of 10 cm in width and 10 cm in depth can be cleaned 12 h by applying a level of 8-V direct electric potential between two panel electrodes. © 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

	abstract = {A greenhouse experiment was set up to investigate the ability of citric acid (CA), oxalic acid (OA), nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) and EDTA for phytoremediation of uranium tailings by Indian mustard [Brassica juncea (L.) Czern. et Coss]. Uranium tailings were collected from Umra mining region and mixed with 75% of garden soil which yielded a 25:75 mixture. Prepared pots were divided into four sets and treated with following different concentrations - 0.1, 0.5, 2.5 and 12.5mmolkg-1 soil additions for each of the four chelators. Control pots which were not treated with chelators. Experiments were conducted in completely randomized block design with triplicates. The optimum concentrations of these chelators were found on the basis of biomass production, tolerance and accumulation potential. The data collected were expressed statistically. EDTA produced maximum growth depression whereas, minimum occurred in the case of NTA. Maximum U uptake (3.5-fold) in the roots occurred at 2.5mmol of CA, while NTA proved to be the weakest for the same purpose. Severe toxicity in the form of reduced growth and plant death was recorded at 12.5mmol of each chelator. Minimum growth inhibition produced by chelators occurred in NTA which was followed by OA, moderate in CA and maximum was traced in EDTA applications. Chelator strengthened U uptake in the present study follows the order: CA>EDTA>OA>NTA. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Low water content sediments were treated with NH3 gas to evaluate changes in U mobility as a potential field remediation method for vadose zone contamination. Injection of NH3 gas created high dissolved NH3 concentrations that followed equilibrium behavior. High NH3 concentration led to an increase in pH from 8.0 to 11 to 13, depending on the water content and NH3 concentration. The increase in pore water pH resulted in a large increase in pore water cations and anions from mineral-phase dissolution. Minerals showing the greatest dissolution included montmorillonite, muscovite, and kaolinite. Pore water ion concentra- tions then decreased with time. Simulations based on initial pore water ion concentrations indicated that quartz, chrysotile, calcite, diaspore, hematite, and Na-boltwoodite (hydrous U silicate) should precipitate. Electrical resistivity and induced polarization tomography (ERT/IP) was able to nonintrusively track these NH3 partitioning, dissolution, and precipi- tations processes through changes in conductivity and chargeability. Ammonia treatment significantly decreases the amount of U present as adsorbed and aqueous species in field- contaminated sediments. In contrast, sediments containing a large fraction of U associated with carbonates generally showed litile change. Uranium leaching from sediments contain- ing high Na-boltwoodite decreased significantly by NH3 treatment, but x-ray absorption near-edge structure/extended x-ray absorption fine structure showed no change in the Na-boltwoodite concentration. Therefore, NH3 treatment of contaminated sediment acts to decrease the highly mobile aqueous and adsorbed U by incorporation into precipitates and appears to decrease mobility of some existing U precipitates (Na-boltwoodite) as a result of mineral coating. © Soil Science Society of America.},

Using some 1m order of magnitude thick inactive cover on the tailings, the requirements for ambient gamma dose rate and for radioactive aerosol generation are fulfilled automatically. Keeping the limits for radon concentration in air and for radon exhalation rate from soil surface is more difficult task due to the high mobility of radon. Construction of suitable radon barrier on the emission sources (first of all: tailings ponds) is one of the basic points of remediation planning. A radon transport model has been developed to study the cover options and the acceptable versions of the available cover layer materials were experimentally surveyed in practice. In the present state the model deals one-dimensional, stationary and single cover layer situations only. The basic soil-physical parameters are involved into the model and their role in radon exhalation rate is particularly analysed. Both the model calculations and the field experiments supported that the official requirements for radon exhalation rate are fulfilled well in the case of applied versions of cover.},

	abstract = {The continual process of increased industrialization, militarization, and urbanization are among the most powerful sources of environmental degradation all over the world. Environmental contamination caused by radionuclides, in particular, by uranium and its decay products, is a serious problem worldwide and has become the common subject for further scientist investigations. It is estimated that the technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials (TENORM) caused by nuclear and non-nuclear technologies, significantly increased natural radioactivity in the last 30 years. The development of nuclear science and technology, uranium mining, production and application of phosphoric fertilizer, the coal industry (mining and combustion), the oil and gas production, metal mining and smelting, mineral processing and building industry are generating radioactive waste that increased natural radioactive level on a regional scale. Economic sanctions for Serbia in the last decade of the 20th century, as well as the transition of its entire economy (which is still ongoing process), the NATO conflict in 1999, and absence of legislation and institutions, are all additional reasons for radioactive contamination of the regional ecosystem of Serbia. Also, one of the main contributing factor of environmental contamination by uranium in Serbia involved the cheap, imported phosphate fertilizers that were often of quality poor and radiological unsafe. This outcome was a direct consequence of the reduced capacity in Serbian national production. On the other hand, according to the available data, many states were documented with bombing sites; 112 sites in Kosovo and Metohija, 12 locations in southern Serbia with depleted uranium (DU) ammunition, during the NATO aggression of Yugoslavia. On this occasion around 10 tons of DU was introduced into environment. The degree of contamination ranges from the bottom limit of 200 Bq/kg to 235,000 Bq/kg in the soil samples of mainly agricultural land, or 1,000 times above the tolerable level. Within the international mission, UNEP and FOCUS and by the engagement of national experts, the decontamination of endangered sites with depleted uranium has only been partially carried out. Today, unfortunately, we encounter an "invisible threat" of depleted uranium ammunition use, with highly radioactive and chemo toxic effect on human health, causing in the last 12 years an enormous increase in cancer rates and a number of newborns with genetic changes. This paper reviews some relevant aspects of environmental contamination with uranium, and gives an overview of the different remediation processes available. This study reviews some relevant aspects of environmental contamination with anthropogenic uranium, primarily from the application of phosphate fertilizers and the use of ammunition with depleted uranium. Our study will include a special accent on Serbia's area concerning the uranium uptake and how it behaves in the food chain and will explore how these indicators impact human health. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

	abstract = {Naturally occurring uranium geochemical anomalies, representative of the several thousand recognized in the Portuguese section of the Iberian Massif and outcropping in three target areas with a total of a few thousand square metres, were subjected to a detailed study (1:1000 scale) to evaluate the radiological health-risk on the basis of a dose assessment. To reach this goal some radioactive isotopes from the uranium, thorium and potassium radioactive series were measured in 52 samples taken from different environmental compartments: soils, stream sediments, water, foodstuff (vegetables) and air; external radiation was also measured through a square grid of 10×10m, with a total of 336 measurements. The results show that some radioisotopes have high activities in all the environmental compartments as well as a large variability, namely for those of the uranium decay chain, which is a common situation in the regional geological setting. Isotopic disequilibrium is also common and led to an enrichment of several isotopes in the different pathways, as is the case of 226Ra; maximum values of 1.76BqL-1 (water), 986Bqkg-1 (soils) and 18.9Bqkg-1 (in a turnip sample) were measured. On the basis of a realistic scenario combined with the experimental data, the effective dose from exposure to ionizing radiation for two groups of the population (rural and urban) was calculated; the effective dose is variable between 8.0 and 9.5mSvyear-1, which is 3-4 times higher than the world average. Thus, the radiological health-risk for these populations could be significant and the studied uranium anomalies must be taken into account in the assessment of the geochemical background. The estimated effective dose can also be used as typical of the background of the Beiras uranium metalogenetic province and therefore as a "benchmark" in the remediation of the old uranium mining sites. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The subject of this study was chemical and radiological characterization of the fly and bottom ash, by-product of the combustion of coal used as an energy source in the former sulfate pulp factory in Plaški. The research involves determination of the concentration of macro, micro and trace elements and activities of the radionuclides in: (i) ash from different positions of the landfill; (ii) soil samples in the zone of the influence of the landfill; (iii) control soil samples and (iv) sediment sample from the river Dretulja. Besides, in situ measurement of an effective dose rate above ash/soil was also determined. In relation with the control soil the average increase of the concentrations of the elements Ca, Cd, Hg, Ni, Se, Sr, Th and U in the samples taken from the fly and bottom ash landfill as well as soil samples within the radius of 300 m from the landfill was 38.3, 6.7, 9.9, 8.5, 9.4, 7.2, 3.6 and 5.7 times, respectively. In these samples, the concentrations of the above mentioned elements were in the following ranges: calcium from 7.94 to 19.7%; cadmium from 0.33 to 1.66 mg/kg; mercury from 0.18 to 0.49 mg/kg; nickel from 260 to 1500 mg/kg; selenium from 2.7 to 21 mg/kg; strontium from 176 to 542 mg/kg; thorium from 8 to 55 mg/kg and uranium from 5.6 to 19.7 mg/kg. Compared to the world's average soil concentration, uranium and thorium values increased 3.7 and 1.7 times, respectively. The mean value of the total effective dose rate measured in the air at the height of 1 m for all samples of ash and soil under the influence of the landfill was 1.60 mSv/yr. Compared to the Croatian average (0.7015 mSv/yr), the determined mean value for the Plaški landfill is two times higher. However, compared to the local background (0.14 mSv/yr), the mean value of the total effective dose rate measured above the Plaški landfill is 11.4 times higher. In the samples of ash and contaminated soil regardless of the sampling location the activity concentrations of the radionuclides in Bq/kg vary in the following ranges: 226Ra from 82.10 to 314.90 (mean value 145.99), 232Th from 32.50 to 223.60 (mean value 76.76) and 238U from 69.10 to 243.20 (mean value 134.38). Compared to the mean values found in the background soil 226Ra and 238U mean activity concentrations increased from 1.6 to 6.4 times and 232Th from 1.4 to 4.3 times. In order to reduce total effective dose rate to the local "background" values and to prevent redistribution of the radionuclides and heavy metals from the deposited material into the environment fly and bottom ash landfill must be sealed with 10 cm thick layer of the material with low permeability.

	abstract = {Effects of uranium stress on plant photosynthetic characteristics and the uptake and translocation of uranium in 12 species plants were investigated during course of the second phytoremediation of the uranium contaminated soil, in order to study the theoretical and methodological basis of uranium-contaminated soil remediation. The results showed that: (1) The photosynthetic efficiency of Iresine herbstii 'Aureo-reticulata', Xanthium sibiricum, Phytolacca Americana L., Solanum indicum and Abutilon theophrasti was inhibited under uranium stress, and the main phenomenon was leaf net photosynthetic rate (Pn) decreased, intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) increased, the initial fluorescence (F0) increased, photosystem II photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), photochemical quenching (qP) and the maximum relative electron transport rate (rETRmaxr) reduced. Nevertheless, the photosynthetic characteristics of Amaranthus retroflexus L., Cichorium intybus L., Bidens pilosa, Helianthus annuus and Beta vulgaris var. cicla exhibited better resistance to uranium stress. (2) Rumex acetosa, Bidens pilosa, Xanthium sibiricum and Helianthus annuus had a strong ability to accumulate uranium, in the second phytoremediation of 485 mg/kg uranium content soil for three months, and the uranium contents in plants were 363.57, 91.87, 75.80 and 65.42 mg/kg, respectively; but Amaranthus retroflexus L., Beta vulgaris var. cicla and Phytolacca Americana L. had a weak ability to accumulate uranium, and the uranium contents in plants were 16.20, 15.11 and 12.36 mg/kg, respectively. (3) The translocation capacity of uranium in plants was weak, and the uranium content of organs in descending order were root, leaf, stem and fructification. In summary, Rumex acetosa, Helianthus annuus and Bidens pilosa could be used as potential remediation plants in the second phytoremediation of uranium-contaminated soil because of the better tolerance to uranium and higher uranium accumulation capacity.},

	abstract = {Redox-interfacial sediments can undergo radical geochemical changes with oscillating tides. In this study, we examine trace element enrichment and availability, at both landscape and pedon-scales, in the surface sediments of a remediating acidic tidal wetland. Fe-rich sediments at the surface-water interface (0-10. mm in depth) were collected across an elevation gradient spanning the supratidal to subtidal range. These sediments were analysed for solid phase Fe fractions and trace elements (As, Pb, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn, V, B, Co, Mo, Ba and U) via dilute HCl-extractions and total digests. Their concentrations were compared with those of underlying (0.05-0.65. m in depth) former sulfuric horizon sediments of a coastal acid sulfate soil (CASS). Reactive Fe was enriched at the redox interface by up to 16 times (197. g. Fe/kg) that of the former sulfuric horizon. The proportion of total trace elements associated with reactive phases was high in interfacial sediments, representing over 90% of B and U and 50% of Pb, Cu, Zn, V and Ba extractable by dilute HCl. The interfacial sediments were particularly enriched in reactive Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, B, Mo and U, with reactive B, Mo and U concentrations between 5 and 10 times greater than in the former sulfuric horizon. Surface enrichment of trace elements is strongly co-associated with Fe(III) mineralisation, likely via sorption and co-precipitation processes. Enrichment is highly spatially heterogeneous and is strongly influenced by elevation and tidal zonation at a landscape-scale and by sediment micro-topography and preferential advective transport via surface connected macropores at the pedon-scale. The results from this study provide new insights to the processes influencing trace element enrichment in Fe-rich redox-interfacial sediments across a remediating acidic tidal wetland. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {As an integral part of nuclear fuel cycle, uranium mining and milling operations are considered to potentially be a significant source of environmental contamination in and around mining facilities. In addition to radionuclides of uranium and thorium decay series, uranium mill tailings are often associated with elevated concentrations of highly toxic heavy metals. The metal and radionuclide contaminated solid residues scattered in uranium mining areas contribute to an extensive contamination of the soil posing the serious risks to living organisms of surrounding areas. The contaminants from waste and tailing dumps in uranium mining and processing sites pose contamination risks to surface water and groundwater. In tailings resulting from acid leaching, the mobilization of radionuclides, metals and metalloids from solid into liquid phase may occur after tailings deposition, even long after rehabilitation of the tailings repository has been completed. Even when mining activities are ceased, these installations continue to have an impact to the environment due to the surface exposure of materials rich in uranium and its radioactive descendants. Currently, many countries have legacy of abandoned uranium mining sites with large amounts of mining waste in surface disposal grounds and remediation actions are being considered for many abandoned sites. In this chapter the risks and hazards associated with radioactive contamination at active and abandoned uranium mining sites and surrounding areas are reviewed. The results of the radiological assessment study conducted in the largest uranium mineralized area in Serbia, where abandoned uranium mines are situated, are presented. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The biosorption experiments for uranium were carried out at a low pH (pH 3.0), where the uranium solution speciation is dominated by highly mobile uranyl ions. The bioaccumulation was found to be the potential mechanism involved in uranium biosorption by Bacillus sp. dwc-2, and the bioaccumulated uranium was deposited in the cell interior as needle shaped particles at pH 3.0, as revealed by TEM analysis as well as EDX spectra. FTIR analysis further suggested that the absorbed uranium was bound to amino, phosphate and carboxyl groups of bacterial cells. Additionally, PIXE and EPBS results confirmed that ion-exchange also contributed to the adsorption process of uranium. All the results implied that the biosorption mechanism of uranium on Bacillus sp. is complicated and at least involves bioaccumulation, ion exchange and complexation process. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The production of 251,000 Mg uranium by the Soviet-East-German mining company SDAG Wismut from 1946 to 1990 based on ore deposits in the densely populated regions of Ronneburg and Seelingstädt in Thuringia and at numerous settlements in Saxony. The activities extending over 100 km2 depreciated 34 km2 with waste rock dumps and ore mill tailings, open pits, more than 50 mine shafts, and 30 drift systems up to 2,900 km in length. Recontouring and restoration of the radionuclide and heavy metal (HM) contaminated sites with an expense of 180 Mio € km-2 was financed by a public fund. Covered by up to 1 m casing soil, the less contaminated sites are afforested, turfed, and stigmatized by their history and the lasting HM release into water systems. They must nevertheless sometimes be returned to productive use. Respective case studies substantiated thus environmental long-term damages inflicted on "reclaimed" subsoil strata at Gessenwiese by infiltrations from onsite ore leaching which ended 15 years ago. Furthermore, grass- and arable lands formed in 1965 from overburden dumps at Seelingstädt were estimated for the compatibility of soils and crops with common hygiene standards. The Corg-deficient sandy Gessenwiese soils pH 3.9-5.2 matched with the usual and permissible HM concentration ranges set for arable land but contaminated the groundwater with CdNiU. The dominance of the highly plant-available free cations and metal-sulphate complexes in the wide absence of organic ligands in the soil solution made four crop plants elevated in MnNiUZn and exceeding the limit of 1 mg kg-1 DW set for Cd in forage. The re-cultured and turfed clay-loam soils pH 6.6-7.2 around Seelingstädt were moderately elevated in AsCdCuZn. Thirty years' applications of composted and liquid husbandry manure raised the humus content to 34 % in the 0-3-cm sward layer, lowered HM concentrations by the same amount, and made the mix of green forage concur with EU hygiene standards. Use of the grasslands as pasturage, e.g., for sheep should nevertheless be confined from Jan to March due to high ingestion rates of roots with the adhering metalliferous soils. Local HM hot spots of arable land were found severely elevated in AsCuMnPbUZn and reached Cd concentrations of 28-40 mg kg-1. Envisaged forage crops of grasses, cereals, and legumes were with Cd concentrations of 4-11 mg kg-1 DW not acceptable. In contrast, seed crops of pea, rye, and an excluder cv. of wheat concurred safely with EU standards of AsPb in food and for Cd in forage and tolerated soil concentrations in AsCuMnUZn 2 to 5 times those currently regarded as permissible. Identical traits denoted HM distributions in the vertical soil profiles of both test sites. In two Gessenwiese test pits, concentrations of 12/4 elements in strata 40-80 cm deep were 29/43 % lower than those at 160-200 cm and could be seen as the outcome of 15 years' relocations. The contemporary annual rates of metal export by test plants and by downwash with seepage water from the total content of a 1-m soil layer remained with 0.03/0.13 % in the negligible range. In 1-m soil profiles at Seelingstädt, HM concentrations in the 4-20-cm (plough) layer of grassland were by 16/52 % significantly lower than mean values determined for the 1-m soil horizon due to apparent relocations of 35 years. Phytoextraction claims thousands to ten thousands of years for comparable rates of HM export. It is concluded that the plough layer of moderately contaminated soils can apparently more be disburdened by downward motions of metal-associated colloids referred to as clay migration rather than by the common mass flow of metals (complexes) and by flopping phytoextractions in practicable time spans of 30-100 years. Seed crops with their out-regulated HM balance recommend themselves for fodder production on non-remediable soils elevated especially in Cd. They tolerate soil HM concentrations beyond the currently permissible limits and reduce the pressure on the quality of soil remediations. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

	abstract = {The effect of three chelating agents (citrate, EDTA, and EDDS) on the solubilization of radium from a granitic soil was studied systematically, considering different soil pH values, chelating agent concentrations, and leaching times. For all the chelating agents tested, the amount of radium leached proved to be strongly dependent on the pH of the substrate: only for acidic conditions did the amount of radium released increase significantly relative to the controls. Under the best conditions, the radium released from the amended soil was greater by factors of 20 in the case of citrate, 18 for EDTA, and 14 for EDDS. The greatest improvement in the release of radium was obtained for the citrate amendment at the highest concentration tested (50mmolkg-1). A slightly lower amount of radium was leached with EDTA at 5mmolkg-1 soil, but the solubilization over time was very different from that observed with citrate or EDDS. With EDTA, a maximum in radium leaching was reached on the first day after amendment, while with citrate, the maximum was attained on the fourth day. With EDDS, radium leaching increased slightly but steadily with time (until the sixth day), but the net effect for the period tested was the lowest of the three reagents. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This investigation shows that tobacco plant roots and leaves accumulate 60 times more uranium than previously reported. Phytoremediation is a convenient technique to clean up polluted soils using herbaceous plants and trees. Increasing research aims to identify novel plant species that accumulate toxic metals. Tobacco plant (Nicotiana tabacum L.) is a promising cultivar for phytoremediation because tobacco is fast growing and easily propagated. Here, we study phytoremediation of uranium by two tobacco varieties Virginia and Burley, bred in natural conditions. Plants were grown on uranium mine tailings with an average uranium content of 15. 3 mg kg-1. Each shoot sample was cross-sectioned into five uniform groups of leaves and stem segments. Results show a substantial variance in uranium uptake according to the section elderliness and origin of the plant parts. The highest concentrations of uranium values recorded in leaves of Burleys and Virginias nearest root shoot sections were 4. 18 and 3. 50 mg kg-1, respectively. These values are 60 times higher rates than those previously published for leaves of cultivars grown under similar conditions. Taking into account the level of soil contamination, the content of accumulated uranium demonstrates uranium hyperaccumulatory properties of tobacco plant and its potential utilization in phytoremediation of uranium-contaminated mediums. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Long-term ingestion of drinking water having As concentration beyond the permissible limit of 50 μg/L leads to detrimental effects on human health. Epidemiological studies have shown that inorganic As is a serious toxicant and can cause a variety of adverse health effects, such as dermal changes, respiratory, pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, haematological, hepatic, renal, neurological, developmental, reproductive, immunologic lead to cancer and other degenerative effects of the circulatory and nervous system (Golub MS, Macintosh MS, Baumrind N, J Toxicol Environ Health Part B 1(3):199-241, 1998; Lin T-H, Huang Y-L, Wang M-Y, J Toxicol Environ Health 53:85-93, 1998; NRC 2001; Ahamed S, Kumar Sengupta M, Mukherjee A, Amir HM, Das B, Nayak B, Pal A, Mukherjee CS, Pati S, Nath DR, Chatterjee G, Mukherjee A, Srivastava R, Chakraborti D, Sci Total Environ 370(2-3):310-322, 2006). In view of the above perspective WHO in 1993 has lowered its earlier permissible limit of 50 μg/L in drinking water to 10 μg/L. The BIS has also endorsed 10 μg/L as the permissible limit for As in drinking water. © Capital Publishing Company 2015.},

	abstract = {Fungal mats which can be artificially established to associate plants in the remediation of heavy-metal contaminated soil comprise primarily mycorrhizal, fairy-ring, and the extremely dense and long-lived coronar mycelia formed by wood-decay fungi around inoculated timber blocks. In mutualistic and antagonistic interactions with the autochthonous soil microflora, fungi are involved in weathering, uptake, and sorption of soil minerals during the degradation of organic residues. They alter availability and plantuptake of (heavy) metals with the release of metal binding substances such as carboxylic acids, polysaccharides, proteins, and the solubilization of the dominating humic acid ligands. To determine the influence of saprobic soil fungi on leaching and plantavailability of macronutrients and heavy metals, Chinese cabbage was potted on metalliferous soil colonized by the coronar mycelia of Hypholoma fasciculare and Kuehneromyces mutabilis. Unplanted and non-inoculated treatments as well as sterilized soil samples inoculated with further soil fungi served as controls. Furthermore, in two open-air plots on non-contaminated soil (4 m2 each) interactions of H. fasciculare with turf grasses, and of K. mutabilis mycelia with the dominating buttercup vegetation were studied. Under sterile conditions, all test fungi but Scytalidium lignicola acidified autoclaved metalliferous soil. Mitosporers depleted NH4+ and NO3- whereas basidiomycetes accumulated NH4+ (1.5-3 times) apparently from the soil's Norg stock and did not compete for the plant's NO3- resources. Fungi known for low carboxylic-acid production on a poor suspended-soil medium increased the solubility of humic substance (HS) together with all of its associated polyvalent metals but Ca moderately by factors 1.3 to 2.2. Aspergillus niger and Fomitopsis pinicola reached solubilization factors of 2.7/3.1 in the case of HS, and of 7 to 54 in the case of the elements, As, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, U, and Zn by chelation with fungal citric and oxalic acids. Calcium precipitated as insoluble oxalate. The fungi reduced the molecular size of humic colloids mainly by the action of carboxylic acids but hardly by laccases, and increased thus their mobility in the mass flow. Nevertheless, the number of dissolved cations per gram of dissolved HS as their main potential ligand remained low in all treatments, inviting them to form the less plant-available metal-humic complexes. Of both coronar mycelia in nonsterile potted soil, only that of H. fasciculare could partly compensate for consume of NH4+ and NO3- by Chinese cabbage. It was however due to the release of fungal toxicants such as fasciculol D that in combination with H. fasciculare and K. mutabilis mycelia, shoot biomass (by 33/ 23 %) and Norg content (by 9/32 %) were reduced. In the absence of strong (heavy) metal chelants in soil, the value of shoot Norg determines the concentrations of the transition metals, (Cd), Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Zn but Fe which are taken up to constitute the plant's metalloproteins. Fixing the conditions in control plants at 100 %, shoot concentrations in the sum of Cu, Mn, Ni, and Zn in H. fasciculare/K. mutabilis associated plants exceeded the level suiting the Norg content with 49/87 %. Considering the lower biomass in relation to plants from noninoculated soil, shoots contained 91/97 % of the four transition metals in absolute amounts. In field plots, both coronar H. fasciculare and K. mutabilis mycelia increased soil NH4+ resources to 300 %. Shoots of the growth-inhibited turf grasses lost 26 % in Norg but reached 60 % more in the sum of Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Zn than the level of Norg made one expect. Buttercup was tolerant of K.-mutabilis inhibitors. Its shoots contained 30 % more in Norg, and 58 % more in the sum of the transition metals than control plants. It is concluded that the surplus in uptake of transition metals goes back to the action of strong chelants in the soil solution of which carboxylic acids, amino acids such as cysteine, and/or non-identified fungal ligands must be taken into account. Basidiomycetes can thus contribute to phytoextraction. Its efficacy was nevertheless impaired by fungal inhibitors of plant growth and Norg formation. Combinations of ground fungi of higher ammonifying and soil acidifying potential with plant species tolerant of fungal inhibitors will thus be tested in further investigations. Solubilization of metal-humic complexes by the combined action of plants and fungi increases the potential leaching rate in potted Settendorf soil by 50 %. This fact is evidence enough that non-symbiotic ground fungi, apart from precipitations of Ca by oxalate, improve plant access to nitrogen and to a surplus in HS- and carboxylate-coordinated elements of moderate stability and plant availability. Moreover, unlike the conditions in mycorrhizal associations, fungal blockage of heavy-metal uptake by the plant is not postulated, and mineral nutrient sequestration at plant expense could not be shown. © 2014 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

	abstract = {The Czech Republic belongs to a group of uranium-rich territories. The world's first uranium mine was in Jáchymov (Joachimsthal). Initially, uranium was mined for uranium glass colouring and later for radium production. After World War II intensive prospecting for uranium was performed all over the Czech Republic. Uranium has been mined in large scale since 1945 in many places both in underground mines and by in-situ chemical leaching. At most mines, the mining was terminated years ago, at present, only one mine is in operation. The processing plants of uranium ore were operated until 1991. Waste rock piles and tailings from the mines and mills are present in many places. Their impact on the environment is the subject of public interest; a large governmental remediation program is being carried out. Part of the waste rock piles were used under control in road construction. From the population exposure point of view, the level of uranium/radium content indoors is very important. Therefore, studies are underway investigating the content of uranium in soil, building materials, drinking water and in urine of the population. A national database of building material now includes several thousands of measurement results. A thorough survey of waterworks was made in 1999 and 2007. Altogether, 3072 samples of water from public supplies were analysed for gross alpha activity. Uranium concentration was determined in those exceeding the guidance level for gross alpha. In over 3% of samples, values higher than 15 μg/L were found. Also, a survey of uranium content in urine was launched The knowledge of uranium levels in the environment and humans will enable us to distinguish the possible increase of uranium content due to the presence of uranium mine waste and other man-made activities. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

	abstract = {The remediation of large heavymetal/radionuclide (HM/R) contaminated areas by conventional remediation technologies is often too expensive. Phytoremediation can be an alternative for such areas with slight contaminations, and represents a convenient and sustainable method of remediation. Field site phytoremediation experiments were carried out at a former uraniummining area in East Germany. The test field site is slightly tomoderately contaminated with HM/R; the phytoremediation was performed by combination of phytostabilization and phytoextraction methods combining microbial, soil and plant techniques both at field- and lab scale. Plant experiments with Triticale, Helianthus annuus and Brassica juncea were performed to investigate the influence of biological additives (fungi, bacteria) and soil amendment strategies (increasing pH and organic matter, fertilizing) on biomass production and plant tolerance to heavy metals. In lysimeter experiments, aminimization of HM/R accumulation in soil could be shown, and groundwater contamination as well as seepage water rate and load could be reduced. The final utilization of HM/R loaded plant residues after harvestswas studied by biogas and ethanolic fermentations and by combustion of the plantmaterial. The fate of HM/R in the different by-productswas investigated. Finally, concepts were developed for the utilization of the HM/R loaded plant residues. © 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {A facultative iron-reducing [Fe(III)-reducing] Paenibacillus sp. strain was isolated from Hanford 300A subsurface sediment biofilms that was capable of reducing soluble Fe(III) complexes [Fe(III)-nitrilotriacetic acid and Fe(III)-citrate] but unable to reduce poorly crystalline ferrihydrite (Fh). However, Paenibacillus sp. 300A was capable of reducing Fh in the presence of low concentrations (2 μM) of either of the electron transfer mediators (ETMs) flavin mononucleotide (FMN) or anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS). Maximum initial Fh reduction rates were observed at catalytic concentrations (<10 μM) of either FMN or AQDS. Higher FMN concentrations inhibited Fh reduction, while increased AQDS concentrations did not. We also found that Paenibacillus sp. 300A could reduce Fh in the presence of natural ETMs from Hanford 300A subsurface sediments. In the absence of ETMs, Paenibacillus sp. 300A was capable of immobilizing U(VI) through both reduction and adsorption. The relative contributions of adsorption and microbial reduction to U(VI) removal from the aqueous phase were~7:3 in PIPES [piperazine-N, N'-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)] and~1:4 in bicarbonate buffer. Our study demonstrated that Paenibacillus sp. 300A catalyzes Fe(III) reduction and U(VI) immobilization and that these reactions benefit from externally added or naturally existing ETMs in 300A subsurface sediments. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.},

	abstract = {A single, large, bulk sample of uranium-contaminated material from the dirt floor of an abandoned metal rolling mill was separated into different types and sizes of aliquots to simulate samples that would be collected during site remediation. The facility rolled approximately 11,000 tons of hot-forged ingots of uranium metal approximately 60 y ago, and it has not been used since that time. Thirty small mass (≈ 0.7 g) and 15 large mass (≈ 70 g) samples were prepared from the heterogeneously contaminated bulk material to determine how measurements of the uranium contamination vary with sample size. Aliquots of bulk material were also resuspended in an exposure chamber to produce six samples of respirable particles that were obtained using a cascade impactor. Samples of removable surface contamination were collected by wiping 100 cm of the interior surfaces of the exposure chamber with 47-mm-diameter fiber filters. Uranium contamination in each of the samples was measured directly using high-resolution gamma ray spectrometry. As expected, results for isotopic uranium (i.e., U and U) measured with the large-mass and small-mass samples are significantly different (p < 0.001), and the coefficient of variation (COV) for the small-mass samples was greater than for the large-mass samples. The uranium isotopic concentrations measured in the air and on the wipe samples were not significantly different and were also not significantly different (p > 0.05) from results for the large- or small-mass samples. Large-mass samples are more reliable for characterizing heterogeneously distributed radiological contamination than small-mass samples since they exhibit the least variation compared to the mean. Thus, samples should be sufficiently large in mass to insure that the results are truly representative of the heterogeneously distributed uranium contamination present at the facility. Monitoring exposure of workers and the public as a result of uranium contamination resuspended during site remediation should be evaluated using samples of sufficient size and type to accommodate the heterogeneous distribution of uranium in the bulk material.

	abstract = {Uranium is a naturally occurring, ubiquitous heavy metal. In various chemical forms, natural uranium is found in all soils, rocks, seas and oceans. It is also present in drinking water and food. Uranium was discovered in 1781 by Klaprot, a pharmacist in Berlin, in the Joachisthal silver mines. This book starts with a short history of uranium. It continues with the legacy of uranium mining and the authors go on to discuss the environmental and health effects of depleted uranium, which has the unique potential to threaten all natural resources, including human society because of its radiotoxic effects. Uranium migration properties are explored through the geological structures and the groundwater systems based on the determination of its total concentration essential for environmental studies. Other chapters examine the recovery of uranium from phosphate rock; the influence of uranium on the environment and the studies of content of uranium in soil, building materials, drinking water and even in the urine of specific population such as in the Czech Republic, a uranium rich territory; the types of uranium deposits; uranium bioremediation as an eco-friendly, promising approach, which will play an irreplaceable role in global nuclear energy development; discussions on uranium as one of the most widespread contaminants in groundwater in mining areas, as well as in surface waters in Brazil; and an examination of fuel materials that have been developed for use in nuclear power reactors including uranium. Bulk uranium-based systems are very complex and it is difficult to draw unambiguous conclusion on their properties and reaction mechanisms from experiments. Therefore in this book, laboratory experiments using simple model systems - thin films, for single effect studies which have a ground-breaking nature are explored in detail in this book. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

	abstract = {Uranium is one of the most toxic radionuclide contaminants and is progressively dispersing in the environment due to the exploration and utilization of nuclear energy. Uranium in the environment endangers both human and animal health, and thus proper management of uranium-contaminated environments has become an urgent need. For treatment of soils contaminated with uranium, traditionally employed chemical (extraction/washing, immobilization) and physical (excavation and disposal) treatment technologies are costly and have produced uncertain results and consequently, alternative pollution control techniques involving various strategies have been considered. Phytoremediation has been widely accepted as an economic, environment-friendly and efficient approach for management of soils contaminated by uranium. As uranium speciation and its bioavailability are closely related to soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, phosphates, carbonates, and iron oxides, they act as key factors influencing uranium uptake by plants. Based on the knowledge of these factors, various soil amendments such as citric acid, calcium carbonate, and phosphate to improve bioavailability of uranium have been proposed. In addition, inoculation of plants with biological amendments such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi has also emerged as an effective remediation strategy for uranium-contaminated soils. In aquatic environments, rhizofiltration can be used as a suitable approach for uranium remediation. With the recent developments, phytoremediation has the potential to become an integral part of the management of uranium-contaminated environments. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Due to the special particularities of uranium and the complexity of components in soil, how to remedy U-contaminated soils becomes an interesting problem in recent years. On the basis of present the domestic and foreign researches, this paper reviews the uranium speciation characteristics in soils, the concept of phytoremediation and electrokinetic remediation, current international research. Restricting factors, advantages and limitations, and the future trends, complementary were discussed too. Phytoremediation is fit for large-scale and low-level uranium contaminated soils, while electrokinetic remediation can be used for higher uranium concentration, bad environment and deep uranium contaminated soils. Combining phytoremediation and electrokinetic remediation is good for remediation of soil contaminated with uranium.

The results show that the plant community are relatively simple in the soils polluted by uranium tailings, in which there are only 31 species of higher plants, belonging to 12 families, including 12 species of gramineae plants, 5 species of compositae plants, 3 species of pteridaceae plants, 3 species of cyperaceae plants, and 1 specie in every other family. There are 28 species of annual or perennial herbs, accounting for 90.3%, and 3 species of shrubs or small trees in this flora. The uranium contents in these 31 plants were also determined. Uranium contents in 14 species of plants, accounting for 45%, are above 200 mg/kg. Of note, uranium content is more than 600 mg/kg in 3 species of plants, which are the water sedge, phleum alpinum and conyza canadensis, respectively.

	abstract = {In 2009, remediation was initiated for a non-operational fuel cycle facility previously used for government contract work located in Windsor, Connecticut, USA. Radiological contaminants consisted primarily of high enriched uranium (HEU). Other radionuclides encountered in relatively minor amounts in certain areas of the clean-up included Co-60, Cs- 137, Ra-226, Th-232 and low enriched uranium (LEU).Between 2009 and the spring of 2011, remediation efforts were focused on demolition of contaminated buildings and removal of contaminated soil. In the late spring of 2011, the last phase of remediation commenced involving the removal of contaminated sediments from portions of a 1,200 meter long gaining stream. Planning and preparation for remediation of the stream began in 2009 with submittal of permit applications to undertake construction activities in a wetland area. The permitting process was lengthy and involved securing permits from multiple agencies. However, early and frequent communication with stakeholders played an integral role in efficiently obtaining the permit approvals. Frequent communication with stakeholders throughout the planning and remediation process also proved to be a key factor in timely completion of the project. The remediation of the stream involved the use of temporary bladder berms to divert surface water flow, water diversion piping, a sediment vacuum removal system, excavation of sediments using small front-end loaders, sediment dewatering, and waste packaging, transportation and disposal. Many safeguards were employed to protect several species of concern in the work area, water management during project activities, challenges encountered during the project, methods of Final Status Survey, and stream restoration.

	abstract = {Uranium is an element with chemical and radiological properties that have made it useful in industry and commerce, but toxic at sufficiently high levels to humans and the environment. Various analytical methods are available to determine the presence, concentration, or quantity of uranium or its isotopes in a range of media. Results confirm that uranium is present in ambient air, water, and soil, so human exposure is assured. At least seven of its more than 100 mineral forms are found at mineable levels in various parts of the world, and the primary producers are in Australia, Canada, China, Kazakhstan, Namibia, Niger, Russia, the United States, and Uzbekistan (WNA, 2013). Uranium is mined primarily for the 235U isotope. The process of enrichment adjusts the ratio of the three natural isotopes (234U, 235U, and 238U) to produce two fractions. The one with an increased proportion of 235U is defined as enriched uranium and is the source of energy production for nuclear reactors and weapons. The remaining portion is depleted in 235U (and also in the more radioactive 234U isotope), so it is termed depleted uranium, and it is less radioactive. Apart from energy production, uranium is used in a range of products that include glass tinting agents, ceramic glazes, gyroscope wheels, chemical catalysts, shields for high-intensity radioactive sources, X-ray tube targets, and military armor and kinetic penetrator munitions, but no longer in dental porcelains. Estimated intakes from water and food are each 0.9-1.5μg/day, with this being variable based on the source of water (higher in groundwater) or type of diet (higher in beef, beef kidney and liver, onions, parsley, and salt, but lower in poultry, fruit juices, fresh and canned fruits and vegetables, and dairy products). Air concentrations are normally low. The highest human exposures result from drinking well water high in uranium and working in the uranium milling and production industries, with the greatest environmental remediation challenge coming from large volumes of mine and mill tailings. Human exposure involves inhalation and ingestion (and, since 1991, military metal fragment wounds). Uranium intestinal absorption is low (0.1-6%, with central values of 1-2.5%), increases with solubility, and is higher for animal neonates and those fasting or iron deficient than for adults. Dermal absorption may not occur across intact skin for insoluble forms, and increases with solubility and extent of skin damage and excoriation, but is lower through severely damaged (e.g. burned) than intact skin (Petitot et al., 2007a). Once absorbed in to the blood, its distribution and elimination kinetics are primarily a function of oxidation state. Uranium entering body fluid in the tetravalent state is converted to the hexavalent uranyl ion, which complexes with available citrate or bicarbonate in blood, or proteins in plasma. Distribution is throughout the body, with primary long-term concentration in the lung (for heavy occupational exposure to insoluble forms), bone, liver, and kidney. Initial elimination is rapid, with at least two phase components for excretion. Computer programs are available to estimate the timeframe concentrations in and radiation doses to the various organs and tissues. It is estimated that inhaling 1μg U/day eventually results in a kidney concentration of 0.003, 0.00075, and 0.000078μg U/g for types F, M, and S uranium, respectively (Leggett et al., 2012). Federal Guidance Report No. 13 (EPA, 2005b) provides Sv/Bq conversion factors for estimating the radiation dose received by the body and selected organs from inhaled or ingested uranium isotopes. Uranium has been found to cross the placenta and to be excreted in breast milk based on elevated levels in the rat fetus following oral exposure of the dam before mating and during gestation and lactation (Sanchez et al., 2006). Overexposure can impact human and animal health. Although uranium is both a chemical and a radioactive material, it has been determined that its adverse health effects are primarily a result of its chemical rather than radiological toxicity (ATSDR, 2013). The damage mechanism for uranium retained in the lung involves injury to the deep lung with the long-term potential for fibrosis and emphysema. The mechanism for renal toxicity involves the accumulation of uranium in the tubular epithelium and subsequent progression to either tubulointerstitial nephritis or tubular necrosis based on exposure level and duration. This may be associated with increased cellular oxidative stress, altered expression of genes involved in cell signaling, and inhibited sodium-dependent phosphate and glucose transport systems. The impact on liver enzymes and receptors might affect drug therapy regimens. Uranium can also interfere with bone remodeling and liver integrity. The health effects from exposure by inhalation, oral, and dermal routes are primarily to the kidney, and it has been shown that this damage can be reversible if not severe. Less severe effects have been observed for the liver and lung, as well as the nervous and reproductive system. Uranium has not been classified as a carcinogen, and cancer has not been observed in high-dose human and animal studies, other than at metal implantation sites, where it has been attributed to a foreign body response. If cancer should develop, bone sarcomas are regarded as the most likely to occur because uranium and radium undergo long-term deposition in the bone and radium dial painters developed bone sarcomas. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Bǎiţa-Ştei was the largest uranium reserve in Romania with estimated reserves of 450,000 tons of high grade metal. It was a large open pit mine in the northwest of Romania (West Carpathian Mountains), situated at 123 km south-east of Oradea, the capital of Bihor County. The transport during the time of sediment by Crişul Bǎiţa water course increased the uranium and radium content in the river meadow. The building material from Crişul Bǎiţa river bed (stone, gravel, sand) was used as construction material for the houses. In addition, some people living on this valley and surroundings after the opening exploitation used as building material the uranium waste from this mine. Preliminary indoor radon measurement (grab samples) in the villages situated on the route of ore transport (Bǎiţa Plai - Ştei) shown high radon concentrations, until 5000 Bq m-3. The new result obtained in this work in springer season 252 Bq m-3 is comparable with the annual means of 241 Bq m-3 and 229 Bq m-3 respectively, previously obtained, but more than twice times higher than the average value of 126 Bq m-3, computed for Romania. About 3000 of etched CR-39 track detectors were used followed by a selection of 20 houses proposed for remediation where a systematic investigation regarding radon sources was performed. The measured indoor radon concentration in the surveyed buildings ranged from 40 to 4000 Bq m-3. For experimental research, a representative pilot house was chosen. This house represents an example of a typical building from this area, with complex and various radon entry pathways which are correlated with the geology of soil. This building was chosen as pilot house due to the fact that it requires different ventilation systems or other remedial measures to be installed.},

	abstract = {The remediation of large heavy metal/radionuclide (HM/R) contaminated areas by conventional ex-situ techniques (excavation or chemical treatment/-stabilization) is expensive, and low cost strategies with a long-term stabilization effect of such sites are a task of next years research. Phytoremediation can be an alterative solution and sustainable technology since low treatment costs make it feasible even for such sites. Field scale investigations were applicated to an area of the former uranium mining in East Thuringia, Germany. On this area, a low grade uranium ore leaching dump was situated, which was later removed during the remediation process of the site. Now, an underground remains that is slightly to moderately contaminated with heavy metals and radionuclides (HM/R) with restrictions of land use. Concepts for remediation of HM/Rcontaminated sites and for the subsequent utilization of the HM/R-loaded plant residues are developed in a joint project. Plant experiments with Triticale, Helianthus annuus, Brassica juncea and Sorghum bicolor were performed revealing the influence of biological additives (mycorrhiza, HM-resistant streptomyces) and soil amendment strategies (increasing pH and organic matter) on biomass production and plant tolerance to heavy metals. In lysimeter experiments it was confirmed, that the different soil improvement strategies, addition of MS and of calcareous top soil (MIX) resulted in a reduction of the concentration of contaminants in the seepage water, as well as of the seepage water rates and loads, thus decreasing the risk of groundwater contamination. Finally, the processing of the heavy metal loaded plant residues was investigated by different methods. Fermentation experiments carried out with Solanum tuberosum and Secale cereale achieved good results compared with industrial standards. Remaining plant parts can be processed in a biogas process, or combusted. Fermentation sludges and combustion ashes act as sinks for HM/R. As results of the project, phytoremediation is a convenient method for the stabilization and remediation of large sites with slight to medium contaminations, and a further utilization of the plant residues by fermentation and biogas production is feasible. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

The extent of reduction of U(VI) presorbed to aluminum oxides was semiquantitatively estimated by comparing the percentages of uranium desorbed by anoxic sodium bicarbonate between AH2DS-reacted and unreacted control samples. X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirmed that U(VI) presorbed to non-nanoporous alumina was rapidly and completely reduced to nanoparticulate uraninite by AH2DS, whereas reduction of U(VI) presorbed to nanoporous alumina was slow and incomplete (<5% reduction after 1 week). The observed nanopore size-dependent redox behavior of U has important implications in developing efficient remediation techniques for the subsurface uranium contamination because the efficiency of in situ bioremediation depends on how effectively and rapidly U(VI) bound to sediment or soil can be converted to an immobile phase. © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {As a nonrenewable resource, phosphorus (P) is the second most important macronutrient for plant growth and nutrition. Demand of phosphorus application in the agricultural production is increasing fast throughout the globe. The bioavailability of phosphorus is distinctively low due to its slow diffusion and high fixation in soils which make phosphorus a key limiting factor for crop production. Applications of phosphorus-based fertilizers improve the soil fertility and agriculture yield but at the same time concerns over a number of factors that lead to environmental damage need to be addressed properly. Phosphate rock mining leads to reallocation and exposure of several heavy metals and radionuclides in crop fields and water bodies throughout the world. Proper management of phosphorus along with its fertilizers is required that may help the maximum utilization by plants and minimum run-off and wastage. Phosphorus solubilizing bacteria along with the root rhizosphere of plant integrated with root morphological and physiological adaptive strategies need to be explored further for utilization of this extremely valuable nonrenewable resource judiciously. The main objective of this review is to assess the role of phosphorus in fertilizers, their uptake along with other elements and signaling during P starvation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Marginal, often contaminated, sites exist in large areas across the world as a result of historic activities such as industry, transportation and mineral extraction. Remediation, or other improvements, of these sites is typically only considered for sites with high exploitation pressure and those posing the highest risks to human health or the environment. At the same time there is increasing competition for land resources for different needs such as biofuel production. Potentially some of this land requirement could be met by production of biomass on brownfield or other marginal land, thereby improving the land while applying the crop cultivation as part of an integrated management strategy. The design and decision making for such a strategy will be site specific. A decision support framework, the Rejuvenate DST (decision support tool) has been developed with the aim of supporting such site specific decision making. This tool is presented here, and has been tested by applying it to a number of case study sites. The consequent SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunities and threats) analysis is discussed and evaluated. The DST was found to be systematic, transparent, and applicable for diverse sites in France, Romania and Sweden, in addition to the sites to which it was applied through its development. The DST is regarded as especially useful if applied as a checklist in an iterative way throughout the decision process, from identifying potential crops to identifying knowledge gaps, working/non-working management strategies and potential risks. The DST also provides a structure promoting effective stakeholder engagement. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Microbial solubilizing of metals in acid environments is successfully used in industrial bioleaching of ores or biomining to extract metals such as copper, gold, uranium and others. This is done mainly by acidophilic and other microorganisms that mobilize metals and generate acid mine drainage or AMD, causing serious environmental problems. However, bioremediation or removal of the toxic metals from contaminated soils can be achieved by using the specific properties of the acidophilic microorganisms interacting with these elements. These bacteria resist high levels of metals by using a few "canonical" systems such as active efflux or trapping of the metal ions by metal chaperones. Nonetheless, gene duplications, the presence of genomic islands, the existence of additional mechanisms such as passive instruments for pH and cation homeostasis in acidophiles and an inorganic polyphosphate-driven metal resistance mechanism have also been proposed. Horizontal gene transfer in environmental microorganisms present in natural ecosystems is considered to be an important mechanism in their adaptive evolution. This process is carried out by different mobile genetic elements, including genomic islands (GI), which increase the adaptability and versatility of the microorganism. This mini-review also describes the possible role of GIs in metal resistance of some environmental microorganisms of importance in biomining and bioremediation of metal polluted environments such as Thiomonas arsenitoxydans, a moderate acidophilic microorganism, Acidithiobacillus caldus and Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans strains ATCC 23270 and ATCC 53993, all extreme acidophiles able to tolerate exceptionally high levels of heavy metals. Some of these bacteria contain variable numbers of GIs, most of which code for high numbers of genes related to metal resistance. In some cases there is an apparent correlation between the number of metal resistance genes and the metal tolerance of each of these microorganisms. It is expected that a detailed knowledge of the mechanisms that these environmental microorganisms use to adapt to their harsh niche will help to improve biomining and metal bioremediation in industrial processes.},

	abstract = {Uranium is an element with chemical and radiological properties that have made it useful in industry and commerce, but toxic at sufficiently high levels to humans and the environment. Various analytical methods are available to determine the presence, concentration, or quantity of uranium or its isotopes in a range of media. Results confirm that uranium is present in ambient air, water, and soil, so human exposure is assured. At least seven of its more than 100 mineral forms are found at mineable levels in various parts of the world, and the primary producers are in Australia, Canada, China, Kazakhstan, Namibia, Niger, Russia, the United States, and Uzbekistan (WNA, 2013). Uranium is mined primarily for the 235U isotope. The process of enrichment adjusts the ratio of the three natural isotopes (234U, 235U, and 238U) to produce two fractions. The one with an increased proportion of 235U is defined as enriched uranium and is the source of energy production for nuclear reactors and weapons. The remaining portion is depleted in 235U (and also in the more radioactive 234U isotope), so it is termed depleted uranium, and it is less radioactive. Apart from energy production, uranium is used in a range of products that include glass tinting agents, ceramic glazes, gyroscope wheels, chemical catalysts, shields for high-intensity radioactive sources, X-ray tube targets, and military armor and kinetic penetrator munitions, but no longer in dental porcelains.Estimated intakes from water and food are each 0.9-1.5. μg/day, with this being variable based on the source of water (higher in groundwater) or type of diet (higher in beef, beef kidney and liver, onions, parsley, and salt, but lower in poultry, fruit juices, fresh and canned fruits and vegetables, and dairy products). Air concentrations are normally low. The highest human exposures result from drinking well water high in uranium and working in the uranium milling and production industries, with the greatest environmental remediation challenge coming from large volumes of mine and mill tailings. Human exposure involves inhalation and ingestion (and, since 1991, military metal fragment wounds). Uranium intestinal absorption is low (0.1-6%, with central values of 1-2.5%), increases with solubility, and is higher for animal neonates and those fasting or iron deficient than for adults. Dermal absorption may not occur across intact skin for insoluble forms, and increases with solubility and extent of skin damage and excoriation, but is lower through severely damaged (e.g. burned) than intact skin (Petitot et al., 2007a). Once absorbed in to the blood, its distribution and elimination kinetics are primarily a function of oxidation state. Uranium entering body fluid in the tetravalent state is converted to the hexavalent uranyl ion, which complexes with available citrate or bicarbonate in blood, or proteins in plasma. Distribution is throughout the body, with primary long-term concentration in the lung (for heavy occupational exposure to insoluble forms), bone, liver, and kidney. Initial elimination is rapid, with at least two phase components for excretion. Computer programs are available to estimate the timeframe concentrations in and radiation doses to the various organs and tissues. It is estimated that inhaling 1. μg U/day eventually results in a kidney concentration of 0.003, 0.00075, and 0.000078. μg U/g for types F, M, and S uranium, respectively (Leggett et al., 2012). Federal Guidance Report No. 13 (EPA, 2005b) provides Sv/Bq conversion factors for estimating the radiation dose received by the body and selected organs from inhaled or ingested uranium isotopes. Uranium has been found to cross the placenta and to be excreted in breast milk based on elevated levels in the rat fetus following oral exposure of the dam before mating and during gestation and lactation (Sanchez et al., 2006). Overexposure can impact human and animal health. Although uranium is both a chemical and a radioactive material, it has been determined that its adverse health effects are primarily a result of its chemical rather than radiological toxicity (ATSDR, 2013). The damage mechanism for uranium retained in the lung involves injury to the deep lung with the long-term potential for fibrosis and emphysema. The mechanism for renal toxicity involves the accumulation of uranium in the tubular epithelium and subsequent progression to either tubulointerstitial nephritis or tubular necrosis based on exposure level and duration. This may be associated with increased cellular oxidative stress, altered expression of genes involved in cell signaling, and inhibited sodium-dependent phosphate and glucose transport systems. The impact on liver enzymes and receptors might affect drug therapy regimens. Uranium can also interfere with bone remodeling and liver integrity. The health effects from exposure by inhalation, oral, and dermal routes are primarily to the kidney, and it has been shown that this damage can be reversible if not severe. Less severe effects have been observed for the liver and lung, as well as the nervous and reproductive system. Uranium has not been classified as a carcinogen, and cancer has not been observed in high-dose human and animal studies, other than at metal implantation sites, where it has been attributed to a foreign body response. If cancer should develop, bone sarcomas are regarded as the most likely to occur because uranium and radium undergo long-term deposition in the bone and radium dial painters developed bone sarcomas. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Cinnamonic soils from southeastern Bulgaria are heavily polluted with radionuclides (uranium, radium) and toxic heavy metals (copper and lead) due to the aerial transportation of fine particles from flotation tailing dumps to the soil surface. As a result of this, the polluted soils are characterized by a slightly alkaline pH (7.82) and positive net neutralization potential (+136.8kgCaCO3/t). A fresh sample of cinnamonic soil was subjected to remediation under laboratory conditions in four lysimeters each containing 70kg of soil. The preliminary study revealed that most of the pollutants were presented as carbonate, reducible and oxidizable fractions, i.e. pollutant ions were specifically adsorbed by carbonate and ferric iron minerals or were capsulated in sulfides. The applied soil treatment was connected with the leaching of the pollutants located mainly in the horizon A, their transportation through the soil profile as soluble forms, and their precipitation in the rich-in-clay subhorizon B3. The efficiency of leaching depended on the activity of the indigenous microflora and on the chemical processes connected with the solubilization of pollutants and formation of stable complexes with some organic compounds and chloride and hydrocarbonate ions. These processes were considerably enhanced by adding hay to the horizon A and irrigating the soil with water solutions containing the above-mentioned ions and some nutrients. After 18months of treatment, each of the soil profiles in the different lysimeters was divided into five sections reflecting the different soil layers. The soil in these sections was subjected to a detailed chemical analysis and the data obtained were compared with the relevant data obtained before the start of the experiment. The best leaching of pollutants from horizon A was measured in the variants where soil mulching was applied. For example, the best leaching of lead (54.5%) was found in the variant combining this technique and irrigation with solutions containing only nutrients. The best leaching of uranium (66.3%), radium (62.5%), and copper (15.1%) was measured in the variant in which the soil was subjected to mulching and irrigation with alkaline solutions containing hydrocarbonate ions. Despite the removal of higher amounts of these pollutants from the soil, the acute soil toxicity towards earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) was higher in comparison to the toxicity of soil that had been treated in other variants. Furthermore, the highly alkaline soil pH (10.47) that was determined through the applied alkaline leaching resulted in an acute soil toxicity to oats (Avena sativa) and clover (Trifolium repens) that was even higher in comparison to the toxicity of the non-treated soil. These data revealed that the soil detoxification was depended not only on the decrease of the total concentration and on the bioavailable forms of the above-mentioned pollutants but also on the changes that had taken place in chemical and geotechnical properties of the treated soil. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In the semiarid region of Brazil, a facility for the production of phosphoric acid for fertilizer is in the last stages of the planning phase. The raw feedstock of Santa Quiteria has a very high level of uranium associated with the phosphate in form of apatite. The reaction by which phosphoric acid is produced generates phosphogypsum (PG) as a by-product. The ratio of phosphogypsum to phosphoric acid is approximately 5 to 1. After all of the phosphate has been extracted and processed, it is expected that some 37 million tons of phosphogypsum will be produced, containing 13Bq/g of 226Ra and 11Bq/g of 210Pb. To assess the potential impact of this PG stack on the surrounding inhabitants, a generic impact assessment was performed using a modeling approach. We estimated the amount and shape of the residue stack and used computational codes for assessing the radiological impact in a prospective risk assessment. A hypothetical farmer scenario was used to calculate two potential doses, one near the site boundary and another directly over the stack piles after the project is shut down. Using a conservative approach, the potential public dose was estimated to be 2.8mSv/y. This study identified the rainfall erosion index, dissolution rate of PG, radionuclide distribution coefficients and fish consumption rate as parameters where improved information could enhance the quality of the dose assessment. The disposal and shape of the stack is of major concern, since the PG erosion might be the main pathway for the environmental contamination; therefore, studies should be carried out to determine a suitable shape and disposal of the stack. Furthermore, containment barriers should be evaluated for their potential to reduce or avoid environmental contamination by runoff. In addition, the onsite public dose underscores the importance of a planning for remediation of the area after the plant is shut down to assure that neither the public nor the environmental health will be affected by the presence of the PG stack. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The Site Brook remediation included soil and/or sediment excavation from wetlands, the wetland buffer zone, and upland areas. In planning the remediation, project team members plotted and evaluated characterization data from the historical surveys. In addition to the in-stream surveys, workers collected sediment samples using a hand auger from each grid where an elevated count rate greater than background was identified. For excavation of areas within the stream channel, AMEC installed a surface water diversion system to convey stream flow around the excavation area and reduce! eliminate the flow of surface water through the excavation. A sump installed in the excavation area collected groundwater recharge into the excavation area and pumped it into a holding tank for radiological sampling and analysis prior to treatment via filtration and discharge to the Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW).},

	abstract = {The paper describes on-going work to control the stability of a large gravity quay wall at a port on the western seaboard of the UK, which has had a history of instability dating back over several decades. In 1999 further ground movements of the wall were triggered by leakage from a fractured water main in the quayside behind the wall. This caused severe settlement damage to the quay and associated storage warehouses on the quayside. Monitoring of the affected area of the wall was established in early 2000, with additional ground investigations and instrumentation to supplement existing data. By the end of September 2000 the worst affected parts of the wall were moving outwards at a rate of 10mm/day. The movements were initially arrested by groundwater lowering. Subsequently additional remedial measures consisting of anchors and shear keys were designed and installed to provide physical restraint. The Owner wished to minimise capital expenditure and instead to use an observational approach (Peck 1969) and to respond to the information obtained. The work had therefore attained what was regarded as an acceptable steady state, with continued managed remediation to ensure that the wall's stability is maintained and the Owner can continue to use the berthing facilities.},

	abstract = {Biogeochemical retention processes, including adsorption, reductive precipitation, and incorporation into host minerals, are important in contaminant transport, remediation, and geologic deposition of uranium. Recent work has shown that U can become incorporated into iron (hydr)oxide minerals, with a key pathway arising from Fe(II)-induced transformation of ferrihydrite, (Fe(OH)3 nH2O) to goethite (α-FeO(OH)); this is a possible U retention mechanism in soils and sediments. Several key questions, however, remain unanswered regarding U incorporation into iron (hydr)oxides and this pathway's contribution to U retention, including: (i) the competitiveness of U incorporation versus reduction to U(IV) and subsequent precipitation of UO2; (ii) the oxidation state of incorporated U; (iii) the effects of uranyl aqueous speciation on U incorporation; and, (iv) the mechanism of U incorporation. Here we use a series of batch reactions conducted at pH ~7, [U(VI)] from 1 to 170μM, [Fe(II)] from 0 to 3mM, and [Ca] at 0 or 4mM coupled with spectroscopic examination of reaction products of Fe(II)-induced ferrihydrite transformation to address these outstanding questions. Uranium retention pathways were identified and quantified using extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Analysis of EXAFS spectra showed that 14-89% of total U was incorporated into goethite, upon reaction with Fe(II) and ferrihydrite. Uranium incorporation was a particularly dominant retention pathway at U concentrations ≤50μM when either uranyl-carbonato or calcium-uranyl-carbonato complexes were dominant, accounting for 64-89% of total U. With increasing U(VI) and Fe(II) concentrations, U(VI) reduction to U(IV) became more prevalent, but U incorporation remained a functioning retention pathway. These findings highlight the potential importance of U(V) incorporation within iron oxides as a retention process of U across a wide range of biogeochemical environments and the sensitivity of uranium retention processes to operative (bio)geochemical conditions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Biological Mn oxidation is responsible for producing highly reactive and abundant Mn oxide phases in the environment that can mitigate metal contamination. However, little is known about Mn oxidation in low-pH environments, where metal contamination often is a problem as the result of mining activities. We isolated two Mn(II)-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) at pH 5.5 (Duganella isolate AB_14 and Albidiferax isolate TB-2) and nine strains at pH 7 from a former uranium mining site. Isolate TB-2 may contribute to Mn oxidation in the acidic Mn-rich subsoil, as a closely related clone represented 16% of the total community. All isolates oxidized Mn over a small pH range, and isolates from low-pH samples only oxidized Mn below pH 6. Two strains with different pH optima differed in their Fe requirements for Mn oxidation, suggesting that Mn oxidation by the strain found at neutral pH was linked to Fe oxidation. Isolates tolerated Ni, Cu, and Cd and produced Mn oxides with similarities to todorokite and birnessite, with the latter being present in subsurface layers where metal enrichment was associated with Mn oxides. This demonstrates that MOB can be involved in the formation of biogenic Mn oxides in both moderately acidic and neutral pH environments. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.},

The treatment was connected with solubilization and removal of the contaminants from the top soil layer (horizon A) due to the joint action of the soil microorganisms (mainly acidophilic chemolithotrophic bacteria) and leach solutions (diluted sulphuric acid) used to irrigate the soil. In one of the plots, the dissolved contaminants were removed from the soil profile through the drainage soil effluents and were subjected to cleaning by a constructed wetland located near this plot. In the other plot, the dissolved contaminants were transferred to the deeply located soil subhorizon B 2 where they were precipitated as the relevant insoluble forms (uranium as uraninite, and the non-ferrous metals as the relevant sulphides) as a result of the activity of the sulphate-reducing bacteria inhabiting this soil subhorizon.

	abstract = {As a key part of water management at the Ranger Uranium Mine (Northern Territory, Australia), stockpile (ore and waste) runoff water was applied to natural woodland on the mine lease in accordance with regulatory requirements. Consequently, the soil in these Land Application Areas (LAAs) presents a range of uranium concentrations. Soil samples were collected from LAAs with different concentrations of uranium and extracts were plated onto LB media containing no (0 ppm), low (3 ppm), medium (250 ppm), high (600 ppm) and very high (1500 ppm) uranium concentrations. These concentrations were similar to the range of measured uranium concentrations in the LAAs soils. Bacteria grew on all plates except for the very high uranium concentrations, where only fungi were recovered. Identifications based on bacterial 16S rRNA sequence analysis showed that the dominant cultivable bacteria belonged to the genus Bacillus. Members of the genera Paenibacillus, Lysinibacillus, Klebsiella, Microbacterium and Chryseobacterium were also isolated from the LAAs soil samples. Fungi were identified by sequence analysis of the intergenic spacer region, and members of the genera Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, Penicillium and Curvularia were dominant on plates with very high uranium concentrations. Members of the Paecilomyces and Alternaria were also present but in lower numbers. These findings indicate that fungi can tolerate very high concentrations of uranium and are more resistant than bacteria. Bacteria and fungi isolated at the Ranger LAAs from soils with high concentrations of uranium may have uranium binding capability and hence the potential for uranium bioremediation. © 2013 .},

Transport is especially relevant for fast reactions, whose rate is controlled by mixing. Therefore, emphasis is placed on mixing driven RT, which requires revising the traditional transport equation (advection-dispersion equation). The mechanics of RT is illustrated through simple cases (single species kinetics, binary reactions). This yields insights into the phenomenon and sets the frame for general RT, whose numerical aspects are also discussed. The chapter concludes with four application examples: (1) dissolution at a fresh-salt water interface (mixing controlled RT); (2) remediation of a 137Cs contaminated soil (cation exchange); (3) RT through fractured media (mixing enhancement by fractures); and (4) uranium migration (complex multicomponent RT). © 2012 Woodhead Publishing Limited All rights reserved.},

Plants were grown on uranium mine tailings with an average uranium content of 15.3 mg kg-1. Each shoot sample was cross-sectioned into five uniform groups of leaves and stem segments. Statistical analysis of the results showed a substantial variance in uranium uptake subject to the section elderliness and origin of the parts. The highest concentrations of uranium values recorded in leaves of Burleys and Virginias nearest root shoot sections were 4.18 mg kg-1and 3.50 mg kg-1, respectively. These are 60 times higher rates than those previously published for leaves of cultivars grown under similar conditions. Taking into account the level of soil contamination, the content of accumulated uranium demonstrates prospective uranium hyperaccumulatory properties of tobacco plant and its potential utilization in phytoremediation of uranium contaminated mediums. © 2012 RAD Conference Proceedings.

	abstract = {High-performance MS instrumentation coupled with improved protein extraction techniques enables metaproteomics to identify active members of soil and groundwater microbial communities. Metaproteomics workflows were applied to study the initial responses (i.e. 4 days post treatment) of the indigenous aquifer microbiota to biostimulation with emulsified vegetable oil (EVO) at a uranium-contaminated site. Members of the Betaproteobacteria (i.e. Dechloromonas, Ralstonia, Rhodoferax, Polaromonas, Delftia, Chromobacterium) and the Firmicutes dominated the biostimulated aquifer community. Proteome characterization revealed distinct differences between the microbial biomass collected from groundwater influenced by biostimulation and groundwater collected upgradient of the EVO injection points. In particular, proteins involved in ammonium assimilation, EVO degradation, and polyhydroxybutyrate granule formation were prominent following biostimulation. Interestingly, the atypical NosZ of Dechloromonas spp. was highly abundant, suggesting active nitrous oxide (N2O) respiration. c-Type cytochromes were barely detected, as was citrate synthase, a biomarker for hexavalent uranium reduction activity, suggesting that uranium reduction has not commenced 4 days post EVO amendment. Environmental metaproteomics identified microbial community responses to biostimulation and elucidated active pathways demonstrating the value of this technique as a monitoring tool and for complementing nucleic acid-based approaches. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

	abstract = {Radiation protection and environmental safety surveillance has been an integral part of the entire uranium mining and ore processing industry in India since the first uranium mine and the mill were commissioned at Jaduguda in 1967. Workplace and environmental monitoring for gamma radiation, radon, airborne long-lived alpha activity and evaluation of workers’ exposure are undertaken in all facilities. Treated tailings are safely confined in engineered containment facilities and regularly monitored to ensure regulatory compliance. Many monitoring devices such as scintillation cell, low level radon detection system, continuous radon monitor, Rn working level meter and SSNTD/TLD based personal dosimeters have been indigenously developed, calibrated and used for monitoring of workplace, personnel and the environment including dwellings. Regular up-gradation of mining and ore processing operations including ventilation system has helped in keeping workers’ exposures well below the prescribed limit. Treated effluents are mostly recycled for use in plants. All releases to the environment are monitored. Used up part of the tailings pond is being provided with appropriate soil and vegetation cover to reduce gamma radiation and radon flux to near natural background levels. Radiation dose to mine workers has shown a downward trend averaging around 5 mSv.y–1 during the past several years. The indigenously developed instruments and monitoring methodologies are described and workplace and environmental monitoring data for over a decade are summarized in this paper. Role of vegetation and plants in the long-term stabilization, confinement and remediation of uranium tailings is discussed. Impact of the operations on the public domain is found to be negligible. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.},

	abstract = {The upward migration of radionuclides in the 238U decay series in soils and their uptake by plants is of interest in various contexts, including the geological disposal of radioactive waste and the remediation of former sites of uranium mining and milling. In order to investigate the likely patterns of behaviour of 238U-series radionuclides being transported upward through the soil column, a detailed soil-plant model originally developed for studying the behaviour of 79Se in soil-plant systems has been adapted to make it applicable to the 238U series. By undertaking a reference case simulation and a series of sensitivity studies, it has been found that a wide variety of behaviour can be exhibited by radionuclides in the 238U decay chain in soils, even when the source term is limited to being a constant flux of either 238U or 226Ra. Hydrological conditions are a primary factor, both in respect of the overall advective flow deeper in the soil, which controls the rate of upward migration, and in the influence of seasonally changing flow directions closer to the soil surface, which can result in the accumulation of radionuclides at specific depths irrespective of changes in sorption between the oxic and anoxic regions of the soil. However, such changes in sorption can also be significant in controlling the degree of accumulation that occurs. This importance of seasonally varying factors in controlling radionuclide transport in soils even in very long-term simulations is a strong argument against the use of annually averaged parameters in long-term assessment models. With a water table that was simulated to fluctuate seasonally from a substantial depth in soil to the surface soil layer, the timing of such variations in relation to the period of plant growth was found to have a major impact on the degree of uptake of radionuclides by plant roots. In long-term safety assessment studies it has sometimes been the practice to model the transport of 226Ra in soil, but to assume that both 210Pb and 210Po can be treated as being present in secular equilibrium with the 226Ra. This simplification is not always appropriate. Where geochemical conditions are such that the 226Ra migrates upward in the soil column faster than 210Pb and 210Po, disequilibrium is not a significant issue, as the 226Ra supports 210Pb and 210Po at concentrations somewhat below those estimated on the basis of assumed secular equilibrium. However, for low, but realistic, values of the distribution coefficients for 210Pb and 210Po and high, but realistic, distribution coefficients for 226Ra, the 210Pb and 210Po can reach the surface soil in high concentrations that are not locally supported by 226Ra. This means that models based on the assumption of secular equilibrium should not be employed without a careful consideration of the hydrological and hydrochemical situation of interest. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Bacteria tolerant to uranium and with phosphate solubilizing ability have proven to be important candidates in the development of bioremediation technology. In this context, we have isolated bacteria from the actinide-metal-containing monazite sand of Someshwara beach, Karnataka (South-West coast of India) with special reference to phosphate solubilizers. Phylogenetic analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing grouped the 32 bacteria into 14 genera belonging to four phyla, namely Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Out of 32 bacteria, 7 solubilized 252.1 ± 14.8 to 1,312.9 ± 53.2 mg L−1phosphate from 5 g L−1tri-calcium phosphate. When tested for uranium sensitivity, all seven selected bacteria showed significant tolerance to uranium compared to the reference strain Escherichia coli ATCC 25922T. Therefore, further investigation of these natural soil isolates, well adapted to complex environmental conditions could lead to prospective applications in remediation of uranium or other heavy metal contaminated sites. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and the University of Milan.},

This test site belongs to the Friedrich-Schiller University Jena and is situated on the ground of a former but now removed uranium mine waste leaching heap. For determination of the U concentrations in the biomaterials, the saps of the samples were squeezed out by using an ultracentrifuge, after that, the uranium concentrations in the saps and the remaining residue were measured, using ICP-MS. The study further showed that uranium concentrations observed in plant compartment and mushroom fruiting bodies sap samples were always higher than their associated solid residue sample. Also, it was found that the detected uranium concentration in the root samples were always higher than were observed in their associated above ground biomass, e.g., in shoots, leaves, blossoms etc. The highest uranium concentration was measured with almost 40 ppb U in a fruiting body of a mushroom and in roots of butterbur. However, the detected uranium concentrations in plants and mushrooms collected in this study were always lower than in the associated surface and soil water of the test site, indicating that under the encountered natural conditions, none of the studied plant and mushroom species turned out to be a hyperaccumulator for uranium, which could have extracted uranium in sufficient amounts out of the uranium-contaminated soil. In addition, it was found that the detected uranium concentrations in the sap samples, despite being above the sensitivity limit, proved to be too low-in combination with the presence of fluorescence quenching substances, e.g., iron and manganese ions, and/or organic quenchers-to extract a useful fluorescence signal, which could have helped to identify the uranium speciation in plants. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {The pilot survey of radon concentration in kindergartens and schools in Kremikovtsi municipality was completed with passive integrating electret detectors during September 2011 – April 2012. Kremikovtsi municipality was chosen due to location close to uranium mining and milling sites. From the results of measurement have been found that the radon concentration in 4 schools and 5 kindergartens were above the recommended reference level of 300 Bq m-3 for existing public buildings. Remedial work commenced in kindergartens and schools with radon concentrations above 300 Bq m-3 in 2012. All buildings were remediated by the installation of active systems (Active Soil Depressurization). Measuring radon after completion of the work is the only accurate indication of the success of the radon protection measures. For conformation of remediation work the post-remediation measurements were performed in October 2012 with passive integrating electret detectors for 1 month. The results show that the radon concentration in all premises is decreased under the recommended reference level. Radon reduction factor and reduction efficiency are calculated for assessing the effectiveness of remediation measures. In 44% of the buildings in which measures are taken to reduce the concentration reduction factor is 6 to 11 times and in the other 56% was between 1.4 and 3. The effectiveness of reducing high radon level in buildings depends on initial radon level, choice of remedy and good building practice. © 2018 RAD Conference Proceedings. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A field investigation was conducted for the vegetation composition and 226Ra uptake by native plant species at a uranium mill tailings impoundment in South China. 80 species belonging to 67 genera in 32 families were recorded in the sampling sites. The Poaceae and Asteraceae were the dominant families colonizing the impoundment. The number of the plant species and vegetation community composition in the sampling sites seemed most closely related to the activities of 226Ra and the pH value of the uranium tailings. The plant species in the sampling sites with relatively low activities of 226Ra and relatively high pH value formed a relatively stable vegetation community. The plant species in the sampling sites with medium activities of 226Ra and medium pH value formed the transitional vegetation community. The plant species in the sampling sites with relatively high activities of 226Ra and relatively low pH value formed a simple unstable vegetation community that was similar to that on the unused grassland. The activities of 226Ra and transfer factors (TFs) varied greatly with the plant species. The high activities of 226Ra and TFs were found in the leaves of Pteris multifida (150.6Bq/g of AW; 9.131), Pteridium aquilinum (122.2Bq/g of AW; 7.409), and Dryopteris scottii (105.7Bq/g of AW; 6.408). They satisfied the criteria for a hyperaccumulator for 226Ra. They may be the candidates for phytoremediation of 226Ra in the uranium mill tailings impoundment areas and the contaminated soils around. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Metal uptake into plant biomass was evaluated to identify optimal plant-microbe combinations for each substrate. Metal bioavailability was found to be plant species and element specific, and influenced by the applied bacterial consortia of 10 strains, each isolated from the same soil to which it was applied. H. annuus showed high extraction capacity for several metals on the German soil independent of inoculation. Our study could also show a significant enhancement of extraction for F. rubra and A. capillaris when combined with the bacterial consortium, although usually grasses are considered metal excluder species. On the Swedish mixed substrate, due to its toxicity, with 30 % bark compost, A. capillaris inoculated with the respective consortium was able to extract multi-metal contaminants. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The concentration of long-lived radionuclides of the 238U series might have harmful effects on living organisms. We studied soil properties and the natural vegetation occurring along a gradient in Los Ratones, an area rehabilitated after uranium mining located in Cáceres, Spain. Soil and vegetation were sampled seasonally and physical and chemical properties of soil were analysed, including natural isotopes of 238U, 230Th, 226Ra and 210Pb. Species richness, diversity, evenness and plant cover were estimated and correlated in relation to soil physical and chemical variables. The location of the sampling sites along a gradient had a strong explanatory effect on the herbaceous species, as well as the presence of shrubs and trees. Seasonal effects of the four natural isotopes were observed in species richness, species diversity and plant cover; these effects were directly related to the pH values in the soil, this being the soil property that most influences the plant distribution. Vegetation in the studied area resembles that of the surroundings, thus proving that the rehabilitation carried out in Los Ratones mine was successful in terms of understorey cover recovery. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Uranium (U)-tolerant aerobic chemo-heterotrophic bacteria were isolated from the sub-surface soils of U-rich deposits in Domiasiat, North East India. The bacterial community explored at molecular level by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) resulted in 51 distinct phylotypes. Bacterial community assemblages at the U mining site with the concentration of U ranging from 20 to 100 ppm, were found to be most diverse. Representative bacteria analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing were affiliated to Firmicutes (51%), Gammaproteobacteria (26%), Actinobacteria (11%), Bacteroidetes (10%) and Betaproteobacteria (2%). Representative strains removed more than 90% and 53% of U from 100 μM and 2 mM uranyl nitrate solutions, respectively, at pH 3.5 within 10 min of exposure and the activity was retained until 24 h. Overall, 76% of characterized isolates possessed phosphatase enzyme and 53% had PIB-type ATPase genes. This study generated baseline information on the diverse indigenous U-tolerant bacteria which could serve as an indicator to estimate the environmental impact expected to be caused by mining in the future. Also, these natural isolates efficient in uranium binding and harbouring phosphatase enzyme and metal- transporting genes could possibly play a vital role in the bioremediation of metal-/radionuclide-contaminated environments.},

	abstract = {Chemical speciation greatly influences the accumulation and distribution of metallic pollutants in plants. This study aimed at evaluating plant differential responses to various speciations of a same element. Uranium (U) was chosen as a model, to which wheat, oilseed rape and sunflower were exposed. Using ICP-MS elemental analysis, together with a panel of imaging techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and particle-induced X-ray emission spectroscopy (PIXE), we show that plant behavior in response to U follows three schemes. When exposed to UO 2 2+ free ion, root adsorption and/or accumulation is high, but U transfer to the shoots is limited by precipitation on cell walls. Complexation with carbonate or citrate reduces U content in roots but drastically increases translocation to the shoots, concentrating U in leaves. Inversely, complexation with phosphate considerably reduces U accumulation in all plant tissues, by precipitation and adsorption of U-rich clusters on root epidermal cells. Finally, our results of U chemical extraction from plant tissues suggest the existence of U-binding proteins. Taken together, these data highlight the role of uranium speciation in the transfer of this metallic pollutant into plants and lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms governing its mobilization, accumulation and distribution in plants. These results will be helpful to improve phytoremediation technology of contaminated soils. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Samples of saprotrophic (34 samples, 24 species) and ectomycorrhizal (38 samples, 26 species) macrofungi were collected from a U-polluted Norway spruce plantation and tailings and analyzed for metal content. In contrast to Ag, which was highly accumulated in fruit-bodies, concentrations of U generally did not exceed 3. mg/kg which indicates a very low uptake rate and efficient exclusion of U from macrofungi. In ectomycorrhizal tips (mostly determined to species level by DNA sequencing), U contents were practically identical with those of the non-mycorrhizal fine spruce roots. These findings suggest a very limited role of macrofungi in uptake and biotransformation of U in polluted forest soils. Furthermore, accumulation of U, Th, Pb and Ag in macrofungal fruit-bodies apparently does not depend on total content and chemical fractionation of these metals in soils (tested by the BCR sequential extraction in this study). © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The physical, chemical, and radiological characteristics of material released to the environment from accidents involving nuclear weapon components are dependent upon many factors, especially the manner in which the material is released and delivered to the environment. These characteristics will also be influenced by physical and chemical effects associated with weathering if the material remains exposed to the environment for a long period of time. This study evaluates the morphological characteristics of particles released to the environment as a result of the 1960 BOMARC incident and compares these characteristics to those described following similar incidents at Thule, Greenland (1968) and Palomares, Spain (1966). Each of these incidents involved unique circumstances and conditions that distributed actinide-rich particles to the environment with a range of distinctive morphological characteristics. Morphological and surface elemental analyses were conducted on a set of discrete particles isolated from samples of post-remediated soil collected at McGuire Air Force Base, the site of the BOMARC incident. Scanning electron microscopy and complimentary energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used to perform the analyses. Non-destructive analysis of uranium and plutonium contained in each particle was measured using high-resolution gamma spectrometry. Unique characteristics of the BOMARC samples include some particles exhibiting a smooth, crystalline texture and varying elemental surface distribution of uranium and plutonium, dependent on the particle's morphology. © Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary 2012.},

The overall objective of this paper was to investigate rhamnolipid, a microbial produced biosurfactant, and its ability to leach uranium present in contaminated soil from an abandoned mine site. Soil samples were collected from two locations in northern Arizona: Cameron (site of open pit mining) and Leupp (control - no mining). The approach taken was to first determine the total uranium content in each soil using a hydrofluoric acid digestion, then comparing the amount of metal removed by rhamnolipid to other chelating agents EDTA and citric acid, and finally determining the amount of soluble metal in the soil matrix using a sequential extraction. Results suggested a complex system for metal removal from soil utilizing rhamnolipid. It was determined that rhamnolipid at a concentration of 150 M was as effective as EDTA but not as effective as citric acid for the removal of soluble uranium. However, the rhamnolipid was only slightly better at removing uranium from the mining soil compared to a purified water control. Overall, this study demonstrated that rhamnolipid ability to remove uranium from contaminated soil is comparable to EDTA and to a lesser extent citric acid, but, for the soils investigated, it is not significantly better than a simple water wash. © 2014 Sara Asselin and Jani C.

	abstract = {Phytoremediation is the technology that uses living plants for in situ remediation of contaminated soils, sediments, tailings and groundwaters, through the removal, containment or degradation of toxic wastes. Growing plants on a contaminated site is a sunlight-driven and energy-efficient technique that is capable of cleaning up an area with low to moderate levels of contamination, and additionally can be ecologically and aesthetically suited to the landscape. Phytoremediation can be used alone or in combination with mechanical (engineering) clean-up methods. Plant-based methods can be used to remove metals, pesticides, solvents, explosives, crude oil, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and radionuclides in landfills (and associated soils and tailings). Phytoremediation has been studied extensively and research is advanced, especially in small-scale operations; however, large-scale applications are currently limited in technology, knowledge and success. Phytoremediation has not been used so far in commercial or industrial decontamination of radioactive sites; however, it has been successfully tested, and some of these advances in radioactive remediation are described. Selection of possible remediation methods used on radioactive wastes primarily depends on the nature of the radioactive isotopes present, and the first part of the chapter covers the types and nature of radioisotope contamination resulting from mining, industry, medicine, accidents and the uranium energy cycle. Innovative new methodologies have been initiated to treat radioactive waste, and some of the most promising are those that rely on phytoremediation. However, it is clear that not all categories of radioactive waste are suitable for phytoremediation. The second part of the review addresses and discusses the different categories of phytoremediation techniques, and which of these may treat and control radioactive contaminated waste. Several different approaches and different plant species are already in the testing and development phase for application to radionuclide wastes. Phytoremediation approaches have the objective of partly restoring the waste sites for eventual use of native plants and animals, and to curtail or eliminate the off-site movement and leaching of the radioactive entities. The performance of phytoremediation, compared to physical methods of remediating radioactive soils depends on several factors, including the composition of soils, the toxicity level of the contaminant, the degree to which plant species fit natural local growth conditions and the type and concentration of the radionuclides both outside and within plants. Nevertheless, phytoremediation has opened up the prospect for a less costly, practical and environmentally sound approach to clean-up low-level radiation waste sites. Detailed discussion of plant species that are capable of phytoextracting and. /. or rhizofiltering harmful radioactive elements from contaminated soils and water is presented, and where such processes are being proposed for use on mine tailings. To a lesser extent, the review addresses contaminants that are derived from existing low- to middle-level radionuclide waste that may need to be stored securely for many years. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Experimental plot consisting of acidic leached cinnamonic forest soil heavily contaminated with radionuclides (mainly U and Ra) and non-ferrous metals (mainly Cu, Zn and Cd) was treated in situ under real field conditions using the activity of the indigenous soil microflora. This activity was enhanced by suitable changes of some essential environmental factors such as pH and water, oxygen and nutrient contents of the soil. The treatment was connected with solubilization and removal of contaminants from the top soil layers (horizon A) due to the joint action of the soil microorganisms and leach solutions used to irrigate the soils (mainly acidophilic chemolithotrophic bacteria and diluted sulphuric acid). The dissolved contaminants were transferred through the drainage soil effluents to the deeply located soil subhorizon B2 where they were precipitated as the relevant insoluble forms (uranium as uraninite, and the non-ferrous metals as the relevant sulphides) as a result of the activity of the sulphate-reducing bacteria inhabiting this soil subhorizon. The effluents from the subhorizon B2 containing much lower concentrations of inorganic contaminants but enriched in dissolved biodegradable organics were subjected to additional treatment in a constructed wetland for removing these residual contaminants. It was also demonstrated that an efficient treatment of the effluents from the subhorizon B2 could be achieved by a microbial fuel cell in which the cleanup was connected with electricity generation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess by different approaches the occupational exposure during the remediation of a tailings dam in an abandoned uranium mining site, with an area of about 13.3 ha and an estimated volume of 1.39 million m3. A hypothetical scenario was created in which the workers involved in the remediation activities were exposed to radiation through both internal and external pathways. It was intended to assess quantitatively the potential exposure of the workforce involved in the remediation works, focussing particularly on the inhalation of radon and on the gamma irradiation from the contaminated soil. Different methodologies were considered based on a deterministic and a probabilistic approach for dose assessment and risk assessment, respectively. The deterministic approach typically employs a highly "conservative" single value for each input parameter. The probabilistic approach employs sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of input parameters using probabilistic distributions of the sensitive parameters. The results indicate that annual effective dose limit for occupational exposure (worst scenario case created) may reach a significant fraction of occupational radiation protection limits. This is also stressed by the values obtained for the occupational risk estimated by Monte Carlo methodology using probabilistic distributions for the input parameters. The results also showed that the pathway with the highest dose does not necessarily correspond to the pathway with the highest risk. Nevertheless, it is well known that probabilistic analysis generally produces more realistic results. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {In the present study, the effects of ionic liquids (ILs) on the stability of nanoparticles in several IL compositions were investigated. In this context, we examined the primary role of ILs in the synthesis of metal/metal oxide nanoparticles and their dispersions extensively. However, the focus of the discussion in this communication centers mainly on the effect of EMIM Ethyl Sulfate on growth and stability of nanoparticles. The dispersion properties of ILs based on their ability to aid the synthesis of uniformly dispersed nanoparticles have been further explored to produce nanoparticles of an effective catalyst useful in water purification, soil remediation and battery applications. Two independent protocols were developed for the synthesis of nanoparticles, namely (a) one pot process via chemical reduction (b) dispersion of the inorganic material in ILs. The protocols are simple, sustainable and environmentally friendly because the processes are conducted in ILs as harmless non-toxic green solvent materials. The catalysts were analyzed by x-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, UV visible spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering as the main methodologies. © KSPE and Springer 2012.},

	abstract = {The conversion of soluble uranyl ions (UO22+) by bacterial reduction to sparingly soluble uraninite (UO2(s)) is being studied as a way of immobilizing subsurface uranium contamination. Under anaerobic conditions, several known types of bacteria including iron and sulfate reducing bacteria have been shown to reduce U (VI) to U (IV). Experiments using a suspension of uraninite (UO2(s)) particles produced by Shewanella putrefaciens CN32 bacteria show a dependence of both longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) magnetic resonance (MR) relaxation times on the oxidation state and solubility of the uranium. Gradient echo and spin echo MR images were compared to quantify the effect caused by the magnetic field fluctuations ($T_{2}^{*} $) of the uraninite particles and soluble uranyl ions. Since the precipitate studied was suspended in liquid water, the effects of concentration and particle aggregation were explored. A suspension of uraninite particles was injected into a polysaccharide gel, which simulates the precipitation environment of uraninite in the extracellular biofilm matrix. A reduction in the T2 of the gel surrounding the particles was observed. Tests done in situ using three bioreactors under different mixing conditions, continuously stirred, intermittently stirred, and not stirred, showed a quantifiable T2 magnetic relaxation effect over the extent of the reaction. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

This review is intended to provide a single comprehensive source of information to anyone involved in undertaking environmental impact assessment studies relating to this decay chain. Conclusions are drawn relating to values and ranges of distribution coefficients appropriate to uranium, thorium, radium, lead and polonium in different soil types and under various environmental conditions. Similarly, conclusions are drawn relating to plant:soil concentration ratios for these elements for different plant and soil types, and consideration is given to the distribution of these elements within plants following both root uptake and foliar application. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

One of the challenges associated with bioremediation is the decay in Geobacter abundance, which has been attributed to the depletion of bio-accessible Fe(III), motivating the investigation of simultaneous amendments of acetate and Fe(III) as an alternative bioremediation strategy. In order to understand the community metabolism of Geobacter and SRBs during artificial substrate amendment, we have created a genome-scale dynamic community model of Geobacter and SRBs using the previously described Dynamic Multi-species Metabolic Modeling framework. Optimization techniques are used to determine the optimal acetate and Fe(III) addition profile. Field-scale simulation of acetate addition accurately predicted the in situ data. The simulations suggest that batch amendment of Fe(III) along with continuous acetate addition is insufficient to promote long-term bioremediation, while continuous amendment of Fe(III) along with continuous acetate addition is sufficient to promote long-term bioremediation. By computationally minimizing the acetate and Fe(III) addition rates as well as the difference between the predicted and target uranium concentration, we showed that it is possible to maintain the uranium concentration below the environmental safety standard while minimizing the cost of chemical additions. These simulations show that simultaneous addition of acetate and Fe(III) has the potential to be an effective uranium bioremediation strategy. They also show that computational modeling of microbial community is an important tool to design effective strategies for practical applications in environmental biotechnology. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Contamination of soils with depleted uranium (DU) from munitions firing occurs in conflict zones and at test firing sites. This study reports the development of a chemical extraction methodology for remediation of soils contaminated with particulate DU. Uranium phases in soils from two sites at a UK firing range, MOD Eskmeals, were characterised by electron microscopy and sequential extraction. Uranium rich particles with characteristic spherical morphologies were observed in soils, consistent with other instances of DU munitions contamination. Batch extraction efficiencies for aqueous ammonium bicarbonate (42-50% total DU extracted), citric acid (30-42% total DU) and sulphuric acid (13-19% total DU) were evaluated. Characterisation of residues from bicarbonate-treated soils by synchrotron microfocus X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed partially leached U(IV)-oxide particles and some secondary uranyl-carbonate phases. Based on these data, a multi-stage extraction scheme was developed utilising leaching in ammonium bicarbonate followed by citric acid to dissolve secondary carbonate species. Site specific U extraction was improved to 68-87% total U by the application of this methodology, potentially providing a route to efficient DU decontamination using low cost, environmentally compatible reagents. © 2013 The Authors.},

In this study, we describe the practical application of MARSSIM process in performing a site remediation and conducting a final status survey and discuss the lessons learned. The release criterion for the site and the building were set up using site-specific parameters that were calculated using RESRAD and RESRAD-Build codes. The planning stage of the final status survey consisted of classifying the site, identifying the survey units and selecting the background reference area using the DQO process. The planning, implementation and assessment of the final status survey for the site and the building of the Uranium Conversion Plant were carried out to demonstrate that residual radioactivity levels meet the release criterion. The null hypothesis must reject in order to demonstrate the objective, null hypothesis is that residual radioactivity in the survey unit exceed the release criterion. The survey results containing the hot spots in the building, a nonparametric statistical test (Wilcoxon Rank Sum) was chosen for assessment due to the presence of the uranium contamination in background soil. The final status survey results showed that the release criteria were satisfied. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Severe environmental problems arise from old uranium mines, which continue to discharge uranium (U) via acid mine drainage water, resulting in soil, subsoil and groundwater contamination. Bioremediation of U contaminated environments has been attempted, but most of the conceptual models propose U removal by cell suspensions of anaerobic bacteria. In this study, strain Rhodanobacter A2-61, isolated from Urgeiriça Mine, Portugal, was shown to resist up to 2 mM of U(vi). The conditions used (low nutrient content and pH 5) potentiated the interaction of the toxic uranyl ion with the tested strain. The strain was able to remove approximately 120 μM of U(vi) when grown aerobically in the presence of 500 μM U. Under these conditions, this strain was also able to lower the phosphate concentration in the medium and increased its capacity to take up inorganic phosphate, accumulating up to 0.52 μmol phosphate per optical density unit of the medium at 600 nm, after 24 hours, corresponding approximately to the late log phase of the bacterial culture. Microscopically dense intracellular structures with nanometer size were visible. The extent of U inside the cells was quantified by LS counting. EDS analysis of heated cells showed the presence of complexes composed of phosphate and uranium, suggesting the simultaneous precipitation of U and phosphate within the cells. XRD analysis of the cells containing the U-phosphate complexes suggested the presence of a meta-autunite-like mineral structure. SEM identified, in pyrolyzed cells, crystalline nanoparticles with shape in the tetragonal system characteristic of the meta-autunite-like mineral structures. U removal has been reported previously but mainly by cell suspensions and through release of phosphate. The innovative Rhodanobacter A2-61 can actively grow aerobically, in the presence of U, and can efficiently remove U(vi) from the environment, accumulating it in a structural form consistent with that of the mineral meta-autunite inside the cell, corresponding to effective metal immobilization. This work supports previous findings that U bioremediation could be achieved via the biomineralization of U(vi) in phosphate minerals. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {Samples of soil, water and plants (terrestrial and aquatics) were collected in the vicinities of the old uranium (U) mine of Sevilha (Tábua, Central Portugal). Fluorometry was the methodology that was adopted for the determination of the U content in samples. Current U soil contamination on the Sevilha mine ranges from 8 to 560 mg/kg. In the most abundant families of terrestrial plants, the results show that the Compositae and Ericaceae families have the highest concentrations. For the Composiatae, an average of 4.91 mg/kg and a maximum of 13.12 mg/kg was found in Helchrysum stoechas and an average of 4.07 mg/kg and a maximum of 10.52 mg/kg was recorded in Hypochaeris radicata. In Erica umbellata an average of 1.70 mg/kg and a maximum of 7.50 mg/kg were obtained. Even though the concentrations obtained in this later species are not high it is particularly interesting because it has a high bioproductivity. Although the U concentrations in waters did not surpass 13 μg/L we have verified that in the vicinities of the mine drainage area, the U concentrations in aquatic plants are higher than in the surrounding water bodies. For these species proved to be uranium accumulators with maximum concentrations: Riccia fluitans (50.59 mg/kg), Lemna minor (52.98 mg/kg), Callitriche stagnallis (55.53 mg/kg) and Lythrum portula (32.93 mg/kg). © SGEM2012 All Rights Reserved by the International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference SGEM Published by STEF92 Technology Ltd.},

The adsorption behavior of uranium (VI) was firstly studied by batch experiments as functions of contact time, pH, liquid/solid ratio, temperature, colloids, minerals and coexistent ions. The results indicated that the adsorption of uranium (VI) by natural soil was efficient at an initial concentration of 10 mg/L uranium (VI) nitrate solution with 100 mg natural soil at room temperature when pH is about 7.0. The adsorption was strongly influenced by the solution pH, contact time, initial concentration and colloids. The adsorption equilibrium for uranium (VI) in soil was obtained within 24 h and the process could be described by the Langmuir adsorption equation. For uranium (VI) desorption, EDTA, citric acid and HNO3 were evaluated under different conditions of temperature, concentration and proportion of liquid to solid. The adsorbed uranium (VI) on natural soil could be easily extracted by all these agents, especially by HNO3, implying that the uranium-contaminated soils can be remedied by these reagents. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {In situ leaching of uranium ores with sulfuric acid during active uranium mining activity on the Gessenheap has caused longstanding environmental problems of acid mine drainage and elevated concentrations of uranium. To study there remediation measures the test site Gessenwiese, a recultivated former uranium mining heap near Ronnenburg/East Thuringia/Germany, was installed as a part of a research program of the Friedrich-Schiller University Jena to study, among other techniques, the phytoremediation capacity of native and selected plants towards uranium. In the first step the uranium speciation in surface seepage and soil pore waters from Gessenwiese, ranging in pH from 3.2 to 4.0, were studied by timeresolved laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS). Both types of water samples showed mono-exponential luminescence decay, indicating the presence of only one major species. The detected emission bands were found at 477.5, 491.8, 513.0, 537.2, 562.3, and 590.7 nm in case of the surface water samples, and were found at 477.2, 493.2, 513.8, 537.0, 562.4, and 590.0 nm in case of the soil water samples. These characteristic peak maxima together with the observed mono-exponential decay indicated that the uranium speciation in the seepage and soil pore waters is dominated by the uranium (VI) sulfate species UO2SO4(aq). Due to the presence of luminescence quenchers in the natural water samples the measured luminescence lifetimes of the UO 2SO4(aq) species of 1.0-2.6 μs were reduced in comparison to pure uranium sulfate solutions, which show a luminescence lifetime of 4.7 μs. These results convincingly show that in the pH range of 3.2-4.0 TRLFS is a suitable and very useful technique to study the uranium speciation in naturally occurring water samples. © 2011 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

	abstract = {Soil contamination with Cd from P fertilizer and other anthropogenic and geogenic sources is a serious problem. In situ immobilization by P application to soil is known as an applicable remediation technique leading to reduced Cd uptake by plants, and use of a Cd-free P fertilizer from renewable sources would be most favorable. Bone char (BC) (15% P, 28% Ca, 0.7% Mg) may be used as such a quality P fertilizer, but it is unknown if its dissolution in soil provides sufficient P and immobilizes Cd in moderately contaminated soils. We incubated BC and triple superphosphate (TSP) in 11 soils that contained between 0.3 to 19.6 mg Cd kg-1 and determined the kinetics of P dissolution during a time period of 145 d. the concomitant Cd immobilization was determined by extracting the mobile Cd with 1 mol L-1 NH4NO3 solution. For most soils, BC increased the concentration of labile P immediately aft er application, reaching a maximum aft er 34 d, although the solubility was below that of TSP (2.9-19.3 vs. 4.1-24.0%). Among five kinetic models, the Langmuir-type equation provided the best description of P dissolution from BC and TSP. the Cd immobilization resulting from BC dissolution exceeded that of TSP by a factor of 1.4 to 2.7. the P dissolution from BC was negatively correlated with pH and positively with P sorption capacity, whereas Cd immobilization was positively correlated with soil pH. these causal relationships were expressed in multiple equations that enable predictions of P dissolution and Cd immobilization and thus may help to introduce BC as sustainable P fertilizer and useful soil amendment. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.},

The main pathways for environmental contamination were deposition on soil surface and topsoil and pollution of deep soil and the aquifer by waste water channel leakage. Soil excavation could be done by classical excavator techniques. An effective removal of material from the saturated zone was possible by using advanced drilling techniques. A large amount of demolished building structure and excavated soil had to be classified. Therefore the use of conveyor detector was necessary. Nearly 100000 Mg of material (excavated soil and demolished building material) were disposed of at an underground mine. A remaining volume of 700 m3 was classified as radioactive waste. Site clearance started in 2006. Groundwater remediation and monitoring is still ongoing, but has already provided excellent results by reducing the remaining Uranium considerably.

	abstract = {Applications of N, P, and K suffice in general to obtain crops rich in biomass, protein, and in those trace metals which are essential for plant's and consumer's health. Whereas trace metal deficiencies in soils can be easily overcome, seriously metalliferous soils lie waste in expectance of cost-efficient remediation treatments. It was recently shown that uptake of the metalloproteid-associated transition metals, (Cd), Co, Cu. Mn, Ni, and Zn as well as Ca and Mg rises and falls near-linearly with the Norg content in dicots. Moreover, traces of phytochelants and certain amino acids in soil trigger a disproportionate uptake of selected elements (Co, Mn), while other amino compounds support dry weight and Norg formation but not the (proportionate) uptake of trace metals. Applications of trace metals to deficient soils or of the soil-N consume initiating hydrocarbons to metalliferous soils to repress Norg formation and (heavy) metal uptake synchronously are therefore not the only ways to optimize the trace metal content of crop plants. In the present study, Chinese cabbage was potted on extremely metalliferous uranium mine dump soil substrates. The original soil Corg 2.5 % (w/w) was attenuated with quartz sand (Corg = 0) to substrates Corg 0.5 and 1.55 %. It was also enriched with Fischer's commercial compost (Corg 21 %) to substrates Corg 6.6 and 9.5 %. The soil was treated in this way to lower the concentrations of hazardous elements in the soil solution by simple attenuation or by sorption to organic matter and, thus, to restrict plant uptake of heavy metals. Compost was also expected to serve as a "hydrocarbon" supplement with effects on the plant's Norg formation and metal homeostasis. Due to the largely differing mineral-N resources from sand-attenuated to the compost-amended soil substrates, dry weight production (5.5 times) and Norg content (3.3 times) of Chinese cabbage shoots varied considerably. In shoot tissues of plants from soil samples Corg 0.5 to 2.5 %, concentrations of the proteid-associated transition metals and of Ca and Mg fell and rose once more near-linearly with Norg. Uptake of certain essential and non-essential elements declined only in the case of plants from soil Corg 0.5 % with its seriously cut metal content. With the introduction of Fischer's compost, the relation between the content in shoot Norg and a proportionate uptake in the sum of the proteid-associated transition metals and in Ca and Mg was dramatically reversed, although these metals remained in solution and did not bind to the compost supplement. Shoot tissues of plants from soil samples Corg 6.6/9.5 % did not form top concentrations in Norg. They contained nevertheless as little as 28/19 % from the quantity of the five transition metals which would theoretically be taken up from non-amended soil to correspond with the quantity of Norg. Uptake of Ca and Mg was also repressed, whereas uptake of non-essential elements was almost not impaired by soil Corg and shoot Norg. Among several other sources of commercial biosolids, Zeus compost (Corg 42 %) restricted the formation of shoot Norg upon the N-consuming degradation of its inherent hexose sugars. The compost did not disrupt the proportionality between concentrations in shoot Norg and in Ca, (Cd), Mg, Ni, and Zn, whereas uptake of Co, Cu, and Mn was selectively repressed. It is concluded that soils contaminated with (Cd), Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Zn but not with other hazardous trace metals could be opened to crop production via application of certain biosolids and a restricted N supply. Crop production on trace metal deficient soils should imply the application of soil acidifying and the formation of plant protein promoting NH4 fertilizers as well as of organic N sources which are mineralized via NH3/NH4+ intermediates. Application of organic carbon should be confined. It is further concluded that changes in the plant's metal homeostasis in the presence of several composts point to a potential role of those microbial plant growth hormones which had been formed during its industrial fermentation. Compost may also serve as a hydrocarbon-like supplement with soil-N sequestration inducing and thus plant Norg and metal uptake restricting properties. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This activity was enhanced by suitable changes in the levels of some essential environmental factors such as pH and water, oxygen and nutrient contents of the soil. The treatment was connected with solubilization and removal of contaminants from the top soil layer (horizon A) due to the joint action of the soil microorganisms (mainly various heterotrophs) and leach solutions used to irrigate the soil (water solutions of bicarbonate and soluble organics). In one of the plots the dissolved contaminants were removed from the soil profile through the drainage soil effluents. In the other plot the dissolved contaminants were transferred to the deeply located soil subhorizon B2 where they were precipitated as the relevant insoluble forms (uranium as uraninite, and the non-ferrous metals as the relevant sulphides) as a result of the activity of the sulfate-reducing bacteria inhabiting this soil subhorizon. This activity was enhanced by injecting water solutions of acetate, lactate, ammonium and phosphate ions to this soil subhorizon. © (2010) by the Australasian Institute for Mining and Metallurgy (AusIMM).},

	abstract = {Methods for remediating groundwaters contaminated with uranium (U) through precipitation under oxidizing conditions are needed because bioreduction-based approaches require indefinite supply of electron donor. Although strategies based on precipitation of some phosphate minerals within the (meta)autunite group have been considered for this purpose, thermodynamic calculations for K- and Ca-uranyl phopsphates, meta-ankoleite and autunite, predict that U concentrations will exceed the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL = 0.13 μM for U) at any pH and pCO2, unless phosphate is maintained at much higher concentrations than the sub-μM levels typically found in groundwaters. We hypothesized that potassium uranyl vanadate will control U(VI) concentrations below regulatory levels in slightly acidic to neutral solutions based on thermodynamic data available for carnotite, K2(UO2) 2V2O8. The calculations indicate that maintaining U concentrations below the MCL through precipitation of carnotite will be sustainable in some oxidizing waters having pH in the range of 5.5 to 7, even when dissolution of this solid phase becomes the sole supply of sub-μM levels of V. Batch experiments were conducted in solutions at pH 6.0 and 7.8, chosen because of their very different predicted extents of U(VI) removal. Conditions were identified where U concentrations dropped below the MCL within 1-5 days of contact with oxidizing solutions containing 0.2-10 mM K, and 0.1-20 μM V(V). This method may also have application in extracting (mining) U and V from groundwaters where they both occur at elevated concentrations. © 2009 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {A pilot-scale system was established to examine the feasibility of in situ U(VI) immobilization at a highly contaminated aquifer (U.S. DOE Integrated Field Research Challenge site, Oak Ridge, TN). Ethanol was injected intermittently as an electron donor to stimulate microbial U(VI) reduction, and U(VI) concentrations fell to below the Environmental Protection Agency drinking water standard (0.03 mg liter-1). Microbial communities from three monitoring wells were examined during active U(VI) reduction and maintenance phases with GeoChip, a high-density, comprehensive functional gene array. The overall microbial community structure exhibited a considerable shift over the remediation phases examined. GeoChip-based analysis revealed that Fe(III)-reducing bacterial (FeRB), nitrate-reducing bacterial (NRB), and sulfate-reducing bacterial (SRB) functional populations reached their highest levels during the active U(VI) reduction phase (days 137 to 370), in which denitrification and Fe(III) and sulfate reduction occurred sequentially. A gradual decrease in these functional populations occurred when reduction reactions stabilized, suggesting that these functional populations could play an important role in both active U(VI) reduction and maintenance of the stability of reduced U(IV). These results suggest that addition of electron donors stimulated the microbial community to create biogeochemical conditions favorable to U(VI) reduction and prevent the reduced U(IV) from reoxidation and that functional FeRB, SRB, and NRB populations within this system played key roles in this process. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.},

	abstract = {In situ remediation of uranium contaminated soil and groundwater is attractive because a diverse range of microbial and abiotic processes reduce soluble and mobile U(VI) to sparingly soluble and immobile U(IV). Often these processes are linked. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), for example, enzymatically reduce U(VI) to U(IV), but they also produce hydrogen sulfide that can itself reduce U(VI). This study evaluated the relative importance of these processes for Desulfovibrio aerotolerans, a SRB isolated from a U(VI)-contaminated site. For the conditions evaluated, the observed rate of SRB-mediated U(VI) reduction can be explained by the abiotic reaction of U(VI) with the microbially-generated H2S. The presence of trace ferrous iron appeared to enhance the extent of hydrogen sulfide-mediated U(VI) reduction at 5 mM bicarbonate, but had no clear effect at 15 mM. During the hydrogen sulfide-mediated reduction of U(VI), a floc formed containing uranium and sulfur. U(VI) sequestered in the floc was not available for further reduction. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

	abstract = {Lysimeter experiments were performed in order to investigate the effects of two bioremediation methods on the export of metals from a former uranium mine site located near Ronneburg, Thuringia, Germany. The first method consisted of the application of topsoil and compost to contaminated soil. Soil was sampled from two amended plots and from an unamended control, all located on a former uranium-leaching heap. The second method involved the mixing of the soil from the control plot with expanded clay, mycorrhizal fungi and Streptomyces sp. The lysimeters were sown with a mixture of two plant species. The export of metals by leaching and by plant uptake from the amended plots was higher than in the control, mainly because of the higher hydraulic conductivity and the higher plant biomass. The inoculation of control soil with mycorrhizal fungi decreased the leaching of metals, but the effect on metal uptake by plants was metal and species dependent. The extra inoculation with Streptomyces sp. increased the leaching of many metals, and also in many cases the metal uptake by plants. The cumulative export by plants and leaching was higher in the treatments with expanded clay in the case of Mg, Mn, Ca, Ni and Pb, smaller in the case of U and Cu, and did not differ in the case of Cr. Copper, Cr, Pb and, to some extent, U tended to accumulate in the top horizon. For these metals, plants played a more important role than the leaching in the total export. For the other metals, a significant decrease in concentrations in the top horizon was associated with a moderate to high export dominated by leaching. © 2008.},

	abstract = {Established in the 1930s, the Northern Transportation Route (NTR) served to transport pitchblende ore 2,200 km from the Port Radium Mine in Canada's Northwest Territories to Fort McMurray in Alberta. From there, the ore was shipped 3,000 km by rail to the Town of Port Hope, Ontario, where it was refined for its radium content and used for medical purposes. Later, transport and refinement focussed on uranium. The corridor of lakes, rivers, portages and roads that made up the NTR included a number of transfer points, where ore was unloaded and transferred to other barges or trucks. Ore was occasionally spilled during these transfer operations and, in some cases, subsequently distributed over larger areas as properties were re-developed or modified. In addition, relatively small volumes of ore were sometimes transported by air to the south. Since 1991, the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Office (LLRWMO), working with communities and its consulting contractors, has conducted surveys to identify and characterize spill sites along the NTR where soils exhibit elevated concentrations of uranium, radium and/or arsenic. In addition to significant areas of impact in Fort McMurray, contamination along the NTR was centred in the Sahtu region near Great Bear Lake and along the southern part of the Slave River. Early radiological investigations found contaminated buildings and soil and occasionally discrete pieces of pitchblende ore at many transfer points and storage areas along the NTR. Where possible, survey work was undertaken in conjunction with property redevelopment activity requiring the relocation of impacted soils (e.g., at Tulita, Fort Smith, Hay River, and Fort McMurray). When feasible to consolidate contaminated material locally, it was placed into Long Term Management Facilities developed to manage and monitor the materials over extended timelines. Radiological activity generated by these engineered facilities are generally below thresholds established by Canadian regulators, meaning they are straightforward to maintain, with minor environmental and community impacts. Securing community acceptance for these facilities is critical, and represents the predominant development component of plans for managing ore-impacted soils. In those circumstances where local consolidation is not achievable, materials have been relocated to disposal facilities outside of the region. The LLRWMO is continuing a program of public consultation, technical evaluation and environmental assessment to develop management plans for the remaining ore-impacted sites on the NTR. This paper will highlight current activities and approaches applied for the responsible management of uranium and radium mining legacies. Copyright © 2011 by ASME.},

The results demonstrated that the sorption of U(VI) was strongly dependent on ionic strength at pH<6.0, and outer-sphere surface complexation may be the main sorption mechanism. The sorption was independent of ionic strength at pH>6.0 and the sorption was mainly dominated by inner-sphere surface complexation. The presence of HA/FA increases U(VI) sorption at low pH, whereas decreases U(VI) sorption at high pH. The thermodynamic parameters (ΔH 0, ΔS 0, and ΔG 0) were calculated from the temperature dependent sorption isotherms, and the results suggested that U(VI) sorption was a spontaneous and endothermic process.

	abstract = {Seven-day batch equilibrium experiments were conducted to measure the efficacy of four phosphate amendments (trisodium trimetaphosphate [TP3], dodecasodium phytate [Na-IP6], precipitated calcium phytate [Ca-IP6], and hydroxyapatite [HA]) for immobilizing Ni and U in organic-rich sediment. Using the eight-step modified Miller's sequential extraction procedure and the USEPA's Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure, the effect of these amendments on the distribution of Ni and U was assessed. Relative to unamended controls, equilibrium aqueous-phase U concentrations were lower following HA and Ca-IP6 additions but higher following TP3 and Na-IP6 amendments, whereas aqueous Ni concentrations were not decreased only in the Na-IP6 amended treatment relative to the control. The poor rates of contaminant immobilization following TP3 and Na-IP6 amendments correlate with the dispersion of organic matter and organomineral colloids, which probably contain sorbed U and Ni. While all amendments shifted the U distribution toward more recalcitrant soil fractions, Ni was redistributed to more labile soil fractions. Th is study cautions that the addition of orthophosphates and organophosphates as contaminant immobilizing amendments may in fact have adverse effects, especially in high-organic soils. Particular attention is warranted at sites with mixed contaminants with varying geochemical behaviors. © 2011 by the American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.},

	abstract = {Accumulation of heavy metals in selective locations of the environment has been attracting considerable public attention over the last decades. The conventional clean-up technologies to extract and remove heavy metals from mining sites are either inadequate or too expensive for developing countries. In the past decades, research efforts have been directed toward phytoextraction by using hyperaccumulators as an alternative, low-cost means of extracting heavy metals from the metal contaminated mining sites. Hyperaccumulating plants are used to transport and concentrate metals from soil into the harvestable parts of plants such as roots and aboveground shoots. Such harvestable biomass is ashed so that the ash can be disposed or even better recycled in metal processing industry for biorecovery of precious and semiprecious metals. This is a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, aesthetically pleasing approach most suitable for developing countries. The authors report the characteristics and mechanisms of hyperaccumulation in metal extraction and also classify the types of hyperaccumulation on the basis of bioavailability of metal to the plant. They also give insight into the role of genetic engineering for enhancing the efficiency of hyperaccumulation in metal extraction. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The site remediated is the waste rock site located on the steep slope of a hill about 1.5 km upstream from a residential area along a main ravine. Major remedial action was to cover these waste rock yards with weathering granite soil. The radon flux density after remediation was intended to be 0.1 Bqm-2s-1 in consideration with the natural background level around Ningyo-toge because there is no value of radon flux density regulated in Japan. Our action decreased the radon concentration in the site to natural background level, approximately from 10 to 40 Bqm-3, although relatively high concentration in excess of 100 Bqm-3 was observed before remediation. On the other hand, our action did not decrease the radon concentrations around the site in general. This fact proved that the limited source such as waste rocks affected the radon concentrations at neighboring area only. The similar tendencies were also observed in other environmental data such as radon progeny concentrations. In conclusion, these findings proved that our remedial action was successful against radon. This fact will lead to more reasonable action plans for other closed mine sites. © 2010 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Remediation of uranium-contaminated sediments through in situ stimulation of bioreduction to insoluble UO2 is a potential treatment strategy underactive investigation. Previously, we found that newly reduced U(IV) can be reoxidized under reducing conditions sustained by a continuous supply of organic carbon (OC) because of residual reactive Fe(III) and enhanced U(VI) solubility through complexation with carbonate generated through OC oxidation. That finding motivated this investigation directed at identifying a range of OC supply rates that is optimal for establishing U bioreduction and immobilization in initially oxidizing sediments. The effects of OC supply rate, from 0 to 580 mmol of OC (kg of sediment)-1 year-1, and OC form (lactate and acetate) on U bioreduction were tested in flow-through columns containing U-contaminated sediments. An intermediate supply rate on the order of 150 mmol of OC (kg of sediment)-1 year-1 was determined to be most effective at immobilizing U. At lower OC supply rates, U bioreduction was not achieved, and U(VI) solubility was enhanced by complexation with carbonate (from OC oxidation). At the highest OC supply rate, the resulting highly carbonate-enriched solutions also supported elevated levels of U(VI), even though strongly reducing conditions were established. Lactate and acetate were found to have very similar geochemical impacts on effluent U concentrations (and other measured chemical species), when compared at equivalent OC supply rates. While the catalysts of U(VI) reduction to U(IV) are presumably bacteria, the composition of the bacterial community, the Fe-reducing community, and the sulfate-reducing community had no direct relationship with effluent U concentrations. The OC supply rate has competing effects of driving reduction of U(VI) to low-solubility U(IV) solids, as well as causing formation of highly soluble U(VI) - carbonato complexes. These offsetting influences will require careful control of OC supply rates in order to optimize bioreduction-based U stabilization. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {An Fe(III)- and uranium(VI)-reducing bacterium, designated strain FRC-32T, was isolated from a contaminated subsurface of the USA Department of Energy Oak Ridge Field Research Center (ORFRC) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the sediments are exposed to mixed waste contamination of radionuclides and hydrocarbons. Analyses of both 16S rRNA gene and the Geobacteraceae-specific citrate synthase (gltA) mRNA gene sequences retrieved from ORFRC sediments indicated that this strain was abundant and active in ORFRC subsurface sediments undergoing uranium(VI) bioremediation. The organism belonged to the subsurface clade of the genus Geobacter and shared 92-98% 16S rRNA gene and 75-81% rpoB gene sequence similarities with other recognized species of the genus. In comparison to its closest relative, Geobacter uraniireducens Rf4T, according to 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, strain FRC-32T showed a DNA-DNA relatedness value of 21 %. Cells of strain FRC-32T were Gramnegative, non-spore-forming, curved rods, 1.0-1.5 mm long and 0.3-0.5 mm in diameter; the cells formed pink colonies in a semisolid cultivation medium, a characteristic feature of the genus Geobacter. The isolate was an obligate anaerobe, had temperature and pH optima for growth at 30 °C and pH 6.7-7.3, respectively, and could tolerate up to 0.7% NaCl although growth was better in the absence of NaCl. Similar to other members of the Geobacter group, strain FRC-32T conserved energy for growth from the respiration of Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide coupled with the oxidation of acetate. Strain FRC-32T was metabolically versatile and, unlike its closest relative, G. uraniireducens, was capable of utilizing formate, butyrate and butanol as electron donors and soluble ferric iron (as ferric citrate) and elemental sulfur as electron acceptors. Growth on aromatic compounds including benzoate and toluene was predicted from preliminary genomic analyses and was confirmed through successive transfer with fumarate as the electron acceptor. Thus, based on genotypic, phylogenetic and phenotypic differences, strain FRC-32T is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Geobacter, for which the name Geobacter daltonii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is FRC-32T (=DSM 22248T =JCM 15807T). © 2010 IUMS.},

	abstract = {A promising remediation approach to mitigate subsurface uranium contamination is the stimulation of indigenous bacteria to reduce mobile U(VI) to sparingly soluble U(IV). The product of microbial uranium reduction is often reported as the mineral uraninite. Here, we show that the end products of uranium reduction by several environmentally relevant bacteria (Gram-positive and Gram-negative) and their spores include a variety of U(IV) species other than uraninite. U(IV) products were prepared in chemically variable media and characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to elucidate the factors favoring/inhibiting uraninite formation and to constrain molecular structure/composition of the non-uraninite reduction products. Molecular complexes of U(IV) were found to be bound to biomass, most likely through P-containing ligands. Minor U(IV)-orthophosphates such as ningyoite [CaU(PO4)2], U2O(PO 4)2, and U2(PO4)(P3O 10) were observed in addition to uraninite. Although factors controlling the predominance of these species are complex, the presence of various solutes was found to generally inhibit uraninite formation. These results suggest a new paradigm for U(IV) in the subsurface, i.e., that non-uraninite U(IV) products may be found more commonly than anticipated. These findings are relevant for bioremediation strategies and underscore the need for characterizing the stability of non-uraninite U(IV) species in natural settings. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {A systematic study was made of the effects of three soil amendments on the solubilization of uranium from a granitic soil. The aim was to optimize solubilization so as to enhance bioavailability for the purposes of remediation. The three amendments tested were with citrate, EDTA, and EDDS as chelating agents. The effects of pH, chelator concentration, and leaching time were studied. The most important factor in uranium solubilization was found to be the pH. In the absence of chelating agents, the greatest solubilization was obtained for alkaline conditions, with values representing about 15% of the total uranium activity in the bulk soil. There were major differences in uranium solubilization between the different amendments. The citrate treatment was the most efficient at acidic pH, particularly with the greatest concentration of citrate tested (50mmolkg -1) after 6 days of treatment. Under these conditions, the uranium concentration in solution was greater by a factor of 356 than in the control suspension, and represented some 63% of the uranium concentration in the bulk soil. Under alkaline conditions, the EDTA and EDDS treatments gave the greatest uranium activity concentrations in solution, but these concentrations were much lower than those with the citrate amendment, and were not very different from the control results. The uranium extraction yield with EDDS amendment was greater than with EDTA. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This work was conducted to assess the impact of uranium (VI) on sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) communities obtained from environmental samples collected on the Portuguese uranium mining area of Urgeiriça. Culture U was obtained from a sediment, while culture W was obtained from sludge from the wetland of that mine. Temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) was used to monitor community changes under uranium stress conditions. TGGE profiles of dsrB gene fragment demonstrated that the initial cultures were composed of SRB species affiliated with Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, Desulfovibrio vulgaris and Desulfomicrobium spp. (sample U), and by species related to D. desulfuricans (sample W). A drastic change in SRB communities was observed as a result of uranium (VI) exposure. Surprisingly, SRB were not detected in the uranium removal communities. Such findings emphasize the need of monitoring the dominant populations during bio-removal studies. TGGE and phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene fragment revealed that the uranium removal consortia are composed by strains affiliated to Clostridium genus, Caulobacteraceae and Rhodocyclaceae families. Therefore, these communities can be attractive candidates for environmental biotechnological applications associated to uranium removal. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Geobacter species specialize in making electrical contacts with extracellular electron acceptors and other organisms. This permits Geobacter species to fill important niches in a diversity of anaerobic environments. Geobacter species appear to be the primary agents for coupling the oxidation of organic compounds to the reduction of insoluble Fe(III) and Mn(IV) oxides in many soils and sediments, a process of global biogeochemical significance. Some Geobacter species can anaerobically oxidize aromatic hydrocarbons and play an important role in aromatic hydrocarbon removal from contaminated aquifers. The ability of Geobacter species to reductively precipitate uranium and related contaminants has led to the development of bioremediation strategies for contaminated environments. Geobacter species produce higher current densities than any other known organism in microbial fuel cells and are common colonizers of electrodes harvesting electricity from organic wastes and aquatic sediments. Direct interspecies electron exchange between Geobacter species and syntrophic partners appears to be an important process in anaerobic wastewater digesters. Functional and comparative genomic studies have begun to reveal important aspects of Geobacter physiology and regulation, but much remains unexplored. Quantifying key gene transcripts and proteins of subsurface Geobacter communities has proven to be a powerful approach to diagnose the in situ physiological status of Geobacter species during groundwater bioremediation. The growth and activity of Geobacter species in the subsurface and their biogeochemical impact under different environmental conditions can be predicted with a systems biology approach in which genome-scale metabolic models are coupled with appropriate physical/chemical models. The proficiency of Geobacter species in transferring electrons to insoluble minerals, electrodes, and possibly other microorganisms can be attributed to their unique " microbial nanowires," pili that conduct electrons along their length with metallic-like conductivity. Surprisingly, the abundant c-type cytochromes of Geobacter species do not contribute to this long-range electron transport, but cytochromes are important for making the terminal electrical connections with Fe(III) oxides and electrodes and also function as capacitors, storing charge to permit continued respiration when extracellular electron acceptors are temporarily unavailable. The high conductivity of Geobacter pili and biofilms and the ability of biofilms to function as supercapacitors are novel properties that might contribute to the field of bioelectronics. The study of Geobacter species has revealed a remarkable number of microbial physiological properties that had not previously been described in any microorganism. Further investigation of these environmentally relevant and physiologically unique organisms is warranted. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background. Decades of improper disposal of uranium-mining wastes on the Navajo Nation has resulted in adverse human and ecological health impacts as well as socio-cultural problems. As the Navajo people become increasingly aware of the contamination problems, there is a need to develop a risk-communication strategy to properly inform tribal members of the extent and severity of the health risks. To be most effective, this strategy needs to blend accepted risk-communication techniques with Navajo perspectives such that the strategy can be used at the community level to inform culturally- and toxicologically-relevant decisions about land and water use as well as mine-waste remediation. Objective. The objective of this study was to develop GIS-based thematic maps as communication tools to clearly identify high risk exposure areas and offer alternatives to minimize public and ecological health impacts. Methods. Thematic maps were produced that incorporated data derived from environmental sampling and public health surveys. The maps show the location and quality of unregulated water resources and identify regulated water sources that could be used as alternatives. In addition, the maps show the location of contaminated soil and sediment areas in which disturbance of surface deposits should be avoided. Preliminary feedback was collected from an informal Navajo working group to assess the clarity and efficacy of this proposed communication method. Results. The working group found the maps to be both clear and effective, and made suggestions for improvements, such as the addition of more map features. The working group predicted that once the maps are presented to the public, water hauling and soil use behaviors will change, and dialogue with chapter officials will be initiated to accelerate further risk reduction efforts. Implications. Because risk communication is complicated by language barriers, lack of infrastructure, and historical mistrust of non-Navajo researchers, mapping provides an easily interpretable medium that can be objectively viewed by community members and decision makers to evaluate activities that affect toxicant exposures. © 2009 deLemos et al.},

This radiological surveillance is based on an environmental monitoring programme implemented by ITN. Annually, soils, water, and plants including horticulture products from the uranium mine areas are sampled and analyzed for radioactivity. As part of this programme, analyses of soils, irrigation waters, agriculture products (lettuce), green pasture, and cheese were performed in samples collected in the area of the old Urgeirica uranium mine and milling facilities near Viseu, Centre-North of Portugal, in order to assess the transfer of uranium series radionuclides to man. In the Urgeirica area, some soils and vegetables display radionuclide concentrations higher than in reference areas 226Ra was the radionuclide more concentrated by vegetables. Through ingestion of these products 226Ra may be the main contributor to the increment of radiation dose received by local population. The solutions implemented for environmental remediation of tailings piles and mining waste dumps in Urgeiriçla and in other old uranium mine sites, with time are expected to render safe these areas and to allow the release of old mining concession areas for other uses by the public without radiation risks. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The remediation of uranium from soils and groundwater at Department of Energy (DOE) sites across the United States represents a major environmental issue, and bioremediation has exhibited great potential as a strategy to immobilize U in the subsurface. The bioreduction of U(VI) to insoluble U(IV) uraninite has been proposed to be an effective bioremediation process in anaerobic conditions. However, high concentrations of nitrate and low pH found in some contaminated areas have been shown to limit the efficiency of microbial reduction of uranium. In the present study, nonreductive uranium biomineralization promoted by microbial phosphatase activity was investigated in anaerobic conditions in the presence of high nitrate and low pH as an alternative approach to the bioreduction of U(VI). A facultative anaerobe, Rahnella sp. Y9602, isolated from soils at DOE's Oak Ridge Field Research Center (ORFRC), was able to respire anaerobically on nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor in the presence of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) as the sole carbon and phosphorus source and hydrolyzed sufficient phosphate to precipitate 95% total uranium after 120 hours in synthetic groundwater at pH 5.5. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy identified the mineral formed as chernikovite, a U(VI) autunite-type mineral. The results of this study suggest that in contaminated subsurfaces, such as at the ORFRC, where high concentrations of nitrate and low pH may limit uranium bioreduction, the biomineralization of U(VI) phosphate minerals may be a more attractive approach for in situ remediation providing that a source of organophosphate is supplied for bioremediation. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {The biomineralization of U(VI) phosphate as a result of microbial phosphatase activity is a promising new bioremediation approach to immobilize uranium in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In contrast to reduced uranium minerals such as uraninite, uranium phosphate precipitates are not susceptible to changes in oxidation conditions and may represent a long-term sink for uranium in contaminated environments. So far, the biomineralization of U(VI) phosphate has been demonstrated with pure cultures only. In this study, two uranium contaminated soils from the Department of Energy Oak Ridge Field Research Center (ORFRC) were amended with glycerol phosphate as model organophosphate source in small flow-through columns under aerobic conditions to determine whether natural phosphatase activity of indigenous soil bacteria was able to promote the precipitation of uranium(VI) at pH 5.5 and 7.0. High concentrations of phosphate (1-3mM) were detected in the effluent of these columns at both pH compared to control columns amended with U(VI) only, suggesting that phosphatase-liberating microorganisms were readily stimulated by the organophosphate substrate. Net phosphate production rates were higher in the low pH soil (0.73±0.17mMd-1) compared to the circumneutral pH soil (0.43±0.31mMd-1), suggesting that non-specific acid phosphatase activity was expressed constitutively in these soils. A sequential solid-phase extraction scheme and X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements were combined to demonstrate that U(VI) was primarily precipitated as uranyl phosphate minerals at low pH, whereas it was mainly adsorbed to iron oxides and partially precipitated as uranyl phosphate at circumneutral pH. These findings suggest that, in the presence of organophosphates, microbial phosphatase activity can contribute to uranium immobilization in both low and circumneutral pH soils through the formation of stable uranyl phosphate minerals. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {In order to test the suitability of using Brassica juncea for the remediation by phytoextraction of soils contaminated with 238U and 226Ra, the transfer process to the plant was studied. A soil with high natural uranium mineralization was used for the study. When the soil was not manipulated, the transfer factor (TF) was 0.24 ± 0.02 and 1.5 ± 0.3 for 238U and 226Ra, respectively. These low values, especially for 238U, are due to the radionuclides being associated in the soils with fractions unavailable to the plant. For the possible use of phytoextraction for remediation of contaminated soils it is therefore necessary to enhance the availability of the radionuclides in the soil. In this sense, soil pH is a major factor influencing the availability of these elements in the soil for plant uptake through their speciation. In this work, the effect of pH on the TF of 238U and 226Ra was studied. Also, citrate was used to attempt to enhance the bioavailability of the two radionuclides in the soils, and therefore their uptake by Brassica juncea and translocation to the shoots. © 2009 EDP Sciences.},

	abstract = {Several microbial communities, obtained from uranium contaminated and non-contaminated samples, were investigated for their ability to remove uranium (VI) and the cultures capable for this removal were further assessed on their efficiency for chromium (VI) removal. The highest efficiency for removal of both metals was observed on a consortium from a non-contaminated soil collected in Monchique thermal place, which was capable to remove 91% of 22 mg L-1 U(VI) and 99% of 13 mg L -1 Cr(VI). This study revealed that uranium (VI) removing communities have also ability to remove chromium (VI), but when uranium (VI) was replaced by chromium (VI) several differences in the structure of all bacterial communities were observed. TGGE and phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene showed that the uranium (VI) removing bacterial consortia are mainly composed by members of Rhodocyclaceae family and Clostridium genus. On the other hand, bacteria from Enterobacteriaceae family were detected in the community with ability for chromium (VI) removal. The existence of members of Enterobacteriaceae and Rhodocyclaceae families never reported as chromium or uranium removing bacteria, respectively, is also a relevant finding, encouraging the exploitation of microorganisms with new abilities that can be useful for bioremediation. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {There is a growing interest in the use of nanoparticles for environmental applications due to their unique physical and chemical properties. One possible application is the removal of contaminants from water. In this study, the use of iron oxide nanoparticles (19.3 nm magnetite and 37.0 nm hematite) were examined to remove arsenate and arsenite through column studies. The columns contained 1.5 or 15 wt% iron oxide nanoparticles and soil. Arsenic experiments were conducted with 1.5 wt% iron oxides at 1.5 and 6 mL/h with initial arsenate and arsenite concentrations of 100 μg/L. Arsenic release occurred after 400 PV, and 100% release was reached. A long-term study was conducted with 15 wt% magnetite nanoparticles in soil at 0.3 mL/h with an initial arsenate concentration of 100 μg/L. A negligible arsenate concentration occurred for 3559.6 pore volumes (PVs) (132.1 d). Eventually, the arsenate concentration reached about 20% after 9884.1 PV (207.9 d). A retardation factor of about 6742 was calculated indicating strong adsorption of arsenic to the magnetite nanoparticles in the column. Also, increased adsorption was observed after flow interruption. Other experiments showed that arsenic and 12 other metals (V, Cr, Co, Mn, Se, Mo, Cd, Pb, Sb, Tl, Th, U) could be simultaneously removed by the iron oxide nanoparticles in soil. Effluent concentrations were less than 10% for six out of the 12 metals. Desorption experiment showed partial irreversible sorption of arsenic to the iron oxide nanoparticle surface. Strong adsorption, large retardation factor, and resistant desorption suggest that magnetite and hematite nanoparticles have the potential to be used to remove arsenic in sandy soil possibly through in situ techniques. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.},

This method has new applications in nonmetallic minerals such as saltpeter and soil remediation. Although a number of experimental studies have been carried out as well as modeling, which allows better understanding of the phenomena and its operation, few studies have been carried out with the objective of optimizing the process. Most of the studies which consider optimization, either experimentally or through the use of models, have been done from a technical perspective. The aim of this work is to develop a methodology for the design and planning of the heap leaching circuit. A superstructure which includes a number of alternative circuits is proposed. Then a mathematical model is developed that represents the constraints of the system and maximizes the profits. An example is considered to validate the proposed methodology. The results show that the current mode of operation of these systems can be improved using this methodology. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The development of nuclear science and technology has led to increasing nuclear waste containing uranium being released and disposed in the environment. The objective of this paper is to develop a better understanding of the techniques for the remediation of soils polluted with radionuclides (uranium in particular), considering: the chemical forms of uranium, including depleted uranium (DU) in soil and other environmental media, their characteristics and concentrations, and some of the effects on environmental and human health; research issues concerning the remediation process, the benefits and results; a better understanding of the range of uses and situations for which each is most appropriate. The paper addresses the main features of the following techniques for uranium remediation: natural attenuation, physical methods, chemical processes (chemical extraction methods from contaminated soils assisted by various suitable chelators (sodium bicarbonate, citric acid, two-stage acid leaching procedure), extraction using supercritical fluids such as solvents, permeable reactive barriers), biological processes (biomineralization and microbial reduction, phytoremediation, biosorption), and electrokinetic methods.

A high-resolution lithological spatial sediment model should be derived from the fi eld data. The paper shows that, caused by the complexity of fl uvial environments, a high-resolution interpretation of the fi eld data failed. That's why geostatistic investigations were used to benefi t the fi eld data interpretation. Under consideration of geological plausibility a more detailed interpretation was derived. Mapping of temporary outcrops and soil physics investigations help to get in addition an idea of the depositions characteristics and genesis. Carbon dating of exhumed wood indicates the sedimentation rate. In the central range the spatial sediment model is characterised by coarse-grained sediments in a direct contact with the Paleozoic basement rocks. They are completely covered by fi ne-grained fl oodplain sediments. Slopes are dominated by slope sediments (debris, sand) and loess. The study area is completely covered by a topsoil layer.

Concentration of radionuclides in water from irrigation wells and in the topsoil layer of the agriculture fields nearby display enhanced concentrations of uranium, radium and polonium. Two types of agriculture land in this area were selected, one with enhanced and another with low uranium concentrations, for controlled growth of lettuce and potatoes. Plants were grown in replicate portions of land (two plots) in each soil type and were periodically irrigated with water from wells. In each soil, one plot was irrigated with water containing low concentration of dissolved uranium and the other plot with water containing enhanced concentration of dissolved uranium. At the end of the growth season, plants were harvested and analysed, along with soil and irrigation water samples. Results show the accumulation of radionuclides in edible parts of plants, specially in the field plots with higher radionuclide concentrations in soil. Radionuclides in irrigation water contributed less to the radioactivity accumulated in plants than radionuclides from soils. Copyright © 2007 by ASME.},

	abstract = {The microbial solubilization of metals in acid environments is productively used in industrial processess called bioleaching of ores or biomining, to extract metals such as copper, gold, and uranium. On the one hand, this is an important biotechnological procedure used in several countries that generates several hundred thousand tons a year of metals such as copper. In addition, acidophilic microorganisms mobilize metals and produce acid mine drainage, causing serious environmental problems. However, bioremediation or removal of the toxic metals from contaminated soils can be achieved by employing the specific properties of microorganisms interacting with metals. Current approaches to the study of microorganisms consider the microorganism or the community as a whole, integrating fundamental biological knowledge with genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and other data to obtain a global picture of how a microbial cell or a community functions. Understanding microbiological phenomena involved in bacteria-mineral interactions such as chemotaxis, quorum sensing, cyclic-bis(3',5') diguanylic acid (c-di-GMP) signaling, adhesion, biofilm formation, metals resistance, and biochemistry of iron and sulfur compounds oxidation will be extremely useful in monitoring and controlling the microbial community to improve the biomining process, making it faster and more efficient. It is expected that the use of different selected or genetically engineered strains with the highest metal resistance values, oxidation capacities, and other enhanced factors of importance in bioleaching of ores will play a key role for industrial biomining in the next decades. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Injection of organic carbon into the subsurface as an electron donor for bioremediation of redox-sensitive contaminants like uranium often leads to mineral transformation and biomass accumulation, both of which can alter the flow field and potentially bioremediation efficacy. This work combines reactive transport modeling with a column experiment and field measurements to understand the biogeochemical processes and to quantify the biomass and mineral transformation/accumulation during a bioremediation experiment at a uranium contaminated site near Rifle, Colorado. We use the reactive transport model CrunchFlow to explicitly simulate microbial community dynamics of iron and sulfate reducers, and their impacts on reaction rates. The column experiment shows clear evidence of mineral precipitation, primarily in the form of calcite and iron monosulfide. At the field scale, reactive transport simulations suggest that the biogeochemical reactions occur mostly close to the injection wells where acetate concentrations are highest, with mineral precipitate and biomass accumulation reaching as high as 1.5% of the pore space. This work shows that reactive transport modeling coupled with field data can be an effective tool for quantitative estimation of mineral transformation and biomass accumulation, thus improving the design of bioremediation strategies. © 2009 American Chemical Society.},

The Rum Jungle mining project is briefly reviewed, followed by a critical evaluation of monitoring data and pollution loads prior to and after rehabilitation - leading to the conclusion that rehabilitation has clearly failed the test of time after just two decades. The most critical findings are the need to understand pollution cycles holistically, and designing monitoring regimes to match, explicit inclusion of radiological criteria (lacking in original planning), and finally the need to set targets based on environmental criteria. Two examples include polluted groundwater which was excluded from rehabilitation and the poor design, construction and/or performance of engineered soil covers - both leading to increasing acid drainage impacts on the Finniss River. The critical review therefore presents a valuable case study of the environmental performance of uranium mine site rehabilitation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We confirmed the reduction of the hexavalent uranium to the tetravalent oxidation state by UV-vis absorption and X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy. Sequential micro- and ultrafiltration of the solution revealed that the bioreduced uranium was present as a colloid with particles between 0.03 and 0.45 μm. Analysis with extended X-ray absorption fine structure revealed the association of the reduced uranium with the phthalic acid as a repeating biligand 1:2 U(IV):phthalic acid polymer. This is the first report of the formation of a U(IV) complexed to two phthalic acid molecules In the form of a polymeric colloid. Although it was proposed that the bioreduction and the precipitation of uranium might be an invaluable strategy to immobilize uranium in contaminated environments, our results suggest that the organic ligands present there might hinder the precipitation of the bioreduced uranium under anaerobic conditions and, thereby, enhance Its environmental mobility as uranium organic complexes or colloids. © 2009 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Massively parallel sequencing has provided a more affordable and high-throughput method to study microbial communities, although it has mostly been used in an exploratory fashion. We combined pyrosequencing with a strict indicator species statistical analysis to test if bacteria specifically responded to ethanol injection that successfully promoted dissimilatory uranium(VI) reduction in the subsurface of a uranium contamination plume at the Oak Ridge Field Research Center in Tennessee. Remediation was achieved with a hydraulic flow cntrol consisting of an inner loop, where ethanol was injected, and an outer loop for flow-field protection. This strategy reduced uranium concentrations in groundwater to levels below 0.126 μM and created geochemical gradients in electron donors from the inner-loop injection well toward the outer loop and downgradient flow path. Our analysis with 15 sediment samples from the entire test area found significant indicatorspecies that showed a high degree of adaptation to the three different hydrochemical-created conditions. Castellaniella and Rhodanobacter characterized areas with low pH, heavy metals, and low bioactivity, while sulfate-, Fe(III)-, and U(VI)-reducing bacteria (Desulfovibrio, Anaeromyxobacter, and Desulfosporosinus) were indicators of areas where U(VI) reduction occurred. The abundance of these bacteria, as well as the Fe(III) and U(VI) reducer Geobacter, correlated with the hydraulic connectivity to the substrate injection site, suggesting that the selected populations were a direct response to electron donor addition by the groundwater flow path. A false-discoveryrate approach was implemented to discard false-positive results by chance, given thelarge amount of data compared. © 2010, American Society for Microbiology.},

Virtually all of these include use of sodium iodide detectors and register detection data with global positioning satellite data. This paper demonstrates how lanthanum bromide detectors can be used to augment existing field surveys in a manner to reduce uncertainty in areas of low count rates and to discriminate between depleted uranium and naturally occurring uranium. The survey system described is equipped with large (20 × 20 × 100 cm) sodium iodide (Alpha Spectra) and 7.5 × 7.5 cm lanthanum bromide (Saint Gobain) detectors. Additional radiological detection equipment (DigiBase) was obtained from ORTEC with survey data collected in the List Mode. Data collected in surveys were then used to generate digital maps using GeoSoft's Oasis Montaj. Software has been developed to automatically identify areas of increased count rates using user-defined thresholds. This software can collect the count data for the masked area and generate a composite spectrum that can be compared to a reference spectrum believed to represent an uncontaminated area. Ratios of counts attributed to protactinium-234m (Pa-234m) are compared to counts attributed to Bismuth-214 (Bi-214) for both the composite filed survey spectrum and thereference spectrum. Soil samples have been collected from selected sites over a range of soil and geology types for the purpose of collecting data comparing high purity germanium (HPGe) detector and lanthanum bromide (LaBr) detector spectra. These samples have come from areas believed to be devoid of depleted uranium contamination and from areas expected to have higher concentrations of naturally occurring uranium. A library of HPGe and LaBr spectra have been collected comparing: (1) background soil samples with, (2) spectra from the same samples that have been doped with half the remediation threshold activity of depleted uranium, and (3) the remediation threshold activity of depleted uranium. Ratios of the Pa-234m:Bi-214 for both HPGe and LaBr detectors are provided in this paper. This process can be repeated for any site of interest. Background soil samples can be obtained prior to surveying and an equivalent library of spectral ratios generated. Field data from three different sites will be used to show how LaBr detectors can be effectively used as an infield HPGe surrogate for rapid discrimination between DU contamination and areas of high naturally occurring uranium. Areas of maps of questionable contamination are selected and composite LaBr spectra are generated along with Pa-234m:Bi-214 ratio. This is compared to library data to determine the approximate activity of DU present. All areas suspected of DU contamination can also be selected and excluded from the remainder of map data. A composite spectrum from the areas believed to be uncontaminated can be generated and spectral ratios compared library data for clearance purposes. Copyright © 2011 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Enrichment-based methods targeted at uranium-tolerant populations among the culturable, aerobic, chemo-heterotrophic bacteria from the subsurface soils of Domiasiat (India's largest sandstone-type uranium deposits, containing an average ore grade of 0.1 % U 3O 8), indicated a wide occurrence of Serratia marcescens. Five representative S. marcescens isolates were characterized by a polyphasic taxonomic approach. The phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences showed their relatedness to S. marcescens ATCC 13880 (≥99.4% similarity). Biochemical characteristics and random amplified polymorphic DNA profiles revealed significant differences among the representative isolates and the type strain as well. The minimum inhibitory concentration for uranium U(VI) exhibited by these natural isolates was found to range from 3. 5-4. 0 mM. On evaluation for their uranyl adsorption properties, it was found that all these isolates were able to remove nearly 90-92% (21-22 mg/L) and 60-70% (285-335 mg/L) of U(VI) on being challenged with 100 μM (23.8 mg/L) and 2 mM (476 mg/L) uranyl nitrate solutions, respectively, at pH 3.5 within 10 min of exposure. his capacity was retained by the isolates even after 24 h of incubation. Viability tests confirmed the tolerance of these isolates to toxic concentrations of soluble uranium U(VI) at pH 3.5. This is among the first studies to report uranium-tolerant aerobic chemoheterotrophs obtained from the pristine uranium ore-bearing site of Domiasiat. © 2011 The Microbiological Society of Korea and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Human exposure to contaminated soils drives clean up criteria at many urban brownfields. Current risk assessment guidelines assume that humans ingest some fraction of soil smaller than 4 mm but have no estimates of what fraction of soil is ingested by humans. Here, we evaluated soil adherence to human hands for 13 agricultural soils from Saskatchewan, Canada and 17 different soils from a brownfield located in Iqaluit, Nunavut, Canada. In addition, we estimated average particle size adhering to human hands for residents of a northern urban setting. Further, we estimated how metal concentrations differed between the adhered and bulk (<4 mm) fraction of soil. The average particle size for adhered agricultural soils was 34 μm, adhered brownfield soils was 105 μm, and particles adhered to human residents was 36 μm. Metals were significantly enriched in these adhered fractions with an average enrichment [(adhered-bulk)/bulk] in metal concentration of 184% (113% median) for 24 different elements. Enrichment was greater for key toxicological elements of concern such as chromium (140%), copper (140%), nickel (130%), lead (110%), and zinc (130%) and was highest for silver (810%), mercury (630%), selenium (500%), and arsenic (420%). Enrichment were positively correlated with carbonate complexation constants (but not bulk solubility products) and suggests that the dominant mechanism controlling metal enrichment in these samples is a precipitation of carbonate surfaces that subsequently adsorb metals. Our results suggest that metals of toxicological concern are selectively enriched in the fraction of soil that humans incidentally ingest. Investigators should likely process soil samples through a 45 μm sieve before estimating the risk associated with contaminated soils to humans. The chemical mechanisms resulting in metal enrichment likely differ between sites but at our site were linked to surface complexation with carbonates. © 2009 American Chemical Society.},

This study quantifies and compares intrinsic solubility and dissolution rate constants of biogenic nano-UO2 and synthetic bulk UO2.00, taking molecular-scale structure into account. Rates were determined under anoxic conditions as a function of pH and dissolved inorganic carbon in continuous-flow experiments. The dissolution rates of biogenic and synthetic UO2 solids were lowest at near neutral pH and increased with decreasing pH. Similar surface area-normalized rates of biogenic and synthetic UO2 suggest comparable reactive surface site densities. This finding is consistent with the identified structural homology of biogenic UO2 and stoichiometric UO2.00 Compared to carbonate-free anoxic conditions, dissolved inorganic carbon accelerated the dissolution rate of biogenic UO2 by 3 orders of magnitude. This phenomenon suggests continuous surface oxidation of U(IV) to U(VI), with detachment of U(VI) as the rate-determining step in dissolution. Although reducing conditions were maintained throughout the experiments, the UO2 surface can be oxidized by water and radiogenic oxidants. Even in anoxic aquifers, UO2 dissolution may be controlled by surface U(VI) rather than U(IV) phases. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Biosorption of uranium from nuclear waste liquids and contaminated surface waters and soils has recently attracted special interest. However, the detailed mechanism of uranium uptake by plants is not well understood. The aim of this work is to investigate the role of cell wall components of the freshwater alga Chara fragilis in uranium sequestration from its solution. Three types of algae preparations: extract of cell wall polysaccharides, dried and live algae were subjected to uranium solutions of different concentration and pH. FTIR and X-ray diffraction were used to assess both potential binding sites and the form of the uranyl sequestered by algae. Sorption of uranium by live and dry algae shows remarkable differences both in terms of overall uptake and mechanisms involved. All experiments are consistent with the conclusion that coprecipitation of uranyl species with CaCO3 is the major binding mechanism in uranium sequestration by Chara fragilis, while the direct exchange of Ca2+ with UO22+ has a minor role. Live algae are twice as efficient in sequestering uranium from solution than dried ones due to the formation of different crystalline forms such as aragonite and rutherfordine forming in live algae in the presence of the uranyl species in solution. It therefore appears that metabolic processes such as photosynthesis, most likely through the regulation of pH, play a key role in the uranium uptake by plants. Further understanding of the complex mechanism of metabolic control of the uranium uptake by plants is needed before the planning of bioremediation of this element. © 2008 EBSA.},

	abstract = {Simple and inexpensive methods for assessing the metabolic status and bioremediation activities of subsurface microorganisms are required before bioremediation practitioners will adopt molecular diagnosis of the bioremediation community as a routine practice for guiding the development of bioremediation strategies. Quantifying gene transcripts can diagnose important aspects of microbial physiology during bioremediation but is technically challenging and does not account for the impact of translational modifications on protein abundance. An alternative strategy is to directly quantify the abundance of key proteins that might be diagnostic of physiological state. To evaluate this strategy, an antibody-based quantification approach was developed to investigate subsurface Geobacter communities. The abundance of citrate synthase corresponded with rates of metabolism of Geobacter bemidjiensis in chemostat cultures. During in situ bioremediation of uranium-contaminated groundwater the quantity of Geobacter citrate synthase increased with the addition of acetate to the groundwater and decreased when acetate amendments stopped. The abundance of the nitrogenfixation protein, NifD, increased as ammonium became less available in the groundwater and then declined when ammonium concentrations increased. In a petroleum-contaminated aquifer, the abundance of BamB, an enzyme subunit involved in the anaerobic degradation of mono-aromatic compounds by Geobacter species, increased in zones in which Geobacter were expected to play an important role in aromatic hydrocarbon degradation. These results suggest that antibody-based detection of key metabolic proteins, which should be readily adaptable to standardized kits, may be a feasible method for diagnosing the metabolic state of microbial communities responsible for bioremediation, aiding in the rational design of bioremediation strategies. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.},

	abstract = {Wyoming is the largest producer of uranium in the United States. An increase in exploration and extraction comes with renewed interest in nuclear power. Associated is a need to be prepared for handling radionuclidecontaminated soils from leaks and surface spills during in-situ recovery (ISR) of uranium. Uranium mining is controversial in the United States. Consideration of methods for remediating contaminated soils is warranted for economic, environmental, and public health reasons. While uranium is removed in the mining process, radium contamination is of concern when leaks or spills occur. Research exists on treatment strategies for radium in soils, including physical, biological and chemical methods. Commonly, contaminated soils are removed and transported off-site for disposal at Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)-approved facilities. This can be quite expensive and involves the added risk of transport of radioactive material along public highways. Having plans in place for otherwise dealing with soils in the event of contamination would be beneficial to industry from economic, regulatory and public relations standpoints. A two-phase study has been designed in which an extensive literature review is conducted of methods used to mitigate radionuclide contamination of soils, particularly that of 226radium (226Ra), and then lab results are used from radiumcontaminated soils specific to a Wyoming mine site to determine a remediation strategy for implementation. Feasibility of strategies are analyzed in relation to soil and vegetation characteristics typical of Wyoming uranium mine lands, so that operators will have access to this information when deciding the best course of action for handling radionuclide-contaminated soils. Preliminary results of the first stage of this project show a dearth of studies on radium in soils, but that some physical, biological and chemical methods have been used and may warrant further consideration.},

Domiasiat (25° 30′ N; 91° 30′ E) has been characterized as the largest, richest, near-surface and low-cost sandstone-type uranium deposit discovered in India. The ores are spread over a 10-square-kilometer area in deposits varying from 8 to 47 meters from the surface. Three metal tolerant Bacillus and Pseudomonas were isolated from the proposed mining sites of Domiasiat. The bacteria were tested for their tolerance against five difterent heavy metals viz. Lead as Lead Nitrate [Pb(NO3)2], Chromium as Potassium Chromate [K2CrO4], Copper as Copper Sulphate [CuSO4.5H2O], Zinc as Zinc Sulphate [ZnSo4.7H2O] and Cadmium as Cadmium Nitrate [Cd(NO3)2.5H2O]. The bacteria were studied for their metal tolerance and antibiotic resistance using various metals and antibiotics. The bacteria exhibited high MIC values for metals and also considerably larger spectrum of antibiotic resistance. The order of toxicity of the metals to the bacteria varied with the isolates, Cadmium being the most toxic metal. These metal tolerant isolates adapted to uranium rich environment can be further explored for their activities such as biosorption, bioprecipitation, extracellular sequestration, transport mechanisms, and/or chelation of heavy metals including Uranium which may open vistas for their utilisation as bioremediation agents.},

	abstract = {As part of an effort to diagnose the physiological status of Geobacter species during in situ bioremediation of uranium-contaminated groundwater, transcript levels for two genes potentially associated with oxidative stress, cydA and sodA, were quantified throughout a bioremediation field study in Rifle, CO, USA. Despite the accumulation of Fe(II) in the groundwater, which is inconsistent with the presence of dissolved oxygen, both genes were highly expressed during the bioremediation process. Therefore, the response to oxidative stress was further evaluated with Geobacter uraniireducens, an isolate from the Rifle site. When G. uraniireducens cultured with fumarate as the electron acceptor was exposed to 5 oxygen for 8h, there was a significant increase in cydA and sodA transcripts as well as other genes associated with oxygen respiration or oxidative stress. Oxygen-exposed cells had lower transcript abundance for genes associated with anaerobic respiration, metabolism and motility. Short-term oxygen exposure had little impact on cydA transcript levels, as more than 1h was required for increases to levels comparable to the subsurface. Abundance of cydA and sodA transcripts for the isolate G. sulfurreducens were always higher in cells cultured with Fe(III) compared with fumarate as an electron acceptor, even when fumarate-grown cells were exposed to oxygen, and Fe(III)-grown cells were grown anaerobically. These results suggest that the apparently high Geobacter cydA and sodA expression during bioremediation cannot necessarily be attributed to oxidative stress and demonstrate that diagnosis of the metabolic status of subsurface microorganisms through transcript analysis should be coupled with appropriate geochemical analyses. © 2009 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {From uranium mining areas, in particular, the radionuclides are usually discharged to the environment during the mining and milling process. At the former uranium mine Žirovski vrh, Slovenia, mine waste and mill tailings were deposited at the Jazbec site and the Boršt site, respectively. Plants grown in soils contaminated with the seepage waters from tailings may represent radiological concern if radionuclides from the uranium decay chain are transferred into the food chain. Uranium is usually accumulated in the roots and translocated to the shoots in limited amounts. Uranium plant accumulators are usually plants from Brassicaceae and Poaceae families. A common reed (Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud.), a tall perennial grass, growing in a wetland habitats, accumulates metals in the above-ground parts. It may be used for phytoremediation of uranium-contaminated soils, because of high biomass production and high metal-accumulation potential. Preliminary results of radionuclide contents measured in such plants, growing on the deposit tailings are presented. A common reed, that was grown on the Boršt tailings pile accumulated 8.6 ± 8 mBq/g dry weight (d.w.) and 2.4 ± 2 mBq/g dry weight (d.w.) of 238U in leaves and stems, respectively.

	abstract = {Radiation protection and environmental safety surveillance has been an integral part of the entire uranium mining and ore processing industry in India since the first uranium mine and the mill were commissioned at Jaduguda in 1967. Workplace and environmental monitoring for gamma radiation, radon, airborne long-lived alpha activity and evaluation of workers' exposure are undertaken in all facilities. Treated tailings are safely confined in engineered containment facilities and regularly monitored to ensure regulatory compliance. Many monitoring devices such as scintillation cell, low level radon detection system, continuous radon monitor, Rn working level meter and SSNTD/TLD based personal dosimeters have been indigenously developed, calibrated and used for monitoring of workplace, personnel and the environment including dwellings. Regular up-gradation of mining and ore processing operations including ventilation system has helped in keeping workers' exposures well below the prescribed limit. Treated effluents are mostly recycled for use in plants. All releases to the environment are monitored. Used up part of the tailings pond is being provided with appropriate soil and vegetation cover to reduce gamma radiation and radon flux to near natural background levels. Radiation dose to mine workers has shown a downward trend averaging around 5 mSv.y-1 during the past several years. The indigenously developed instruments and monitoring methodologies are described and workplace and environmental monitoring data for over a decade are summarized in this paper. Role of vegetation and plants in the long-term stabilization, confinement and remediation of uranium tailings is discussed. Impact of the operations on the public domain is found to be negligible. © Springer 2011.},

Background uranium concentration in the soil from the mine was determined to be 168 mg/kg using the ICP-OES calibrated against the uranium atomic absorption standard solution. Thus the bacteria isolated from the site were expected to be resistant to uranium-6 [U(VI)] toxicity. Preliminary studies using mixed cultures suggest that uranium reduction occurs under anaerobic conditions in most cases. U(VI) reduction by obligate aerobes isolated from the soil consortium was poor. The pure cultures namely; Pseudomonas sp., Pantoea sp. and Enterobacter sp. showed a high reduction rate at pH 5-6. The initial U(VI) reduction rate determined at 50% of added U(VI) was highest in the Pseudomonas sp. at 30 mg/L. Enterobacter sp. outperformed the other two species at 200 mg/L and 400 mg/L with a rate of 63 and 198 mg/L/h, respectively. Rapid reduction was observed in all cultures during the first 4-6 h of incubation with equilibrium conditions obtained only after incubation for 24 h. The results demonstrate the potential of microbial U(VI) reduction as an alternative technology to currently used physical/chemical processes for treatment and recovery of uranium in the nuclear industry. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Many potential environmental hazards have been observed and the data would be of use to the government in its remediation plan for the study area. The high hazard indices require taking adequate measures to check exposures, and an underground lining in the waste ponds to prevent direct contact with the waste pile is recommended.

Mining waste, milling tailings and acid mine waters are the on site remains of this extractive activity. Environmental radioactivity measurements were performed in and around these sites in order to assess the dispersal of radionuclides from uranium mining waste and the spread of acidic waters resulting from the in situ uranium leaching with sulphuric acid. Results show migration of acid waters into groundwater around the Cunha Baixa mine. This groundwater is tapped by irrigation wells in the agriculture area near the Cunha Baixa village. Water from wells displayed uranium (238U) concentrations up to 19x103 mBq L-1 and sulphate ion concentrations up to 1070 mg L-1. These enhanced concentrations are positively correlated with low water pH, pointing to a common origin for radioactivity, dissolved sulphate, and acidity in underground mining works. Radionuclide concentrations were determined in horticulture and farm products from this area also and results suggest low soil to plant transfer of radionuclides and low food chain transfer of radionuclides to man. Analysis of aerosols in surface air showed re suspension of dust from mining and milling waste heaps. Therefore, it is recommended to maintain mine water treatment and to plan remediation of these mine sites in order to prevent waste dispersal in the environment.},

	abstract = {46 actinomycetes were isolated from two polluted sites and one unpolluted site. One strain, F4, was selected through primary qualitative screening assays because of its cadmium resistance, and physiologically and taxonomically characterized. F4 was able to grow at 7.5% NaCl and 100 μg/ml lysozyme and at a pH between 6 and 10. 16S rDNA sequence analysis showed that F4 was closely related to Streptomyces tendae. Growth of Streptomyces sp. F4 on culture medium with 8 mg/l Cd2++ for 8 days showed 80% inhibition. Maximum specific biosorption was 41.7 mg Cd2++/g dry weight after 7 days of growth and highest Cd2++ concentration was found in the cell wall (41.2%). The exopolysaccharide layer only contained 7.4%, whereas 39.4% of Cd2++ was found in the cytosolic fraction. Twelve % was found in the ribosomes and membrane fraction. This was verified with TEM, showing Streptomyces sp. F4 cytoplasm with dark granulate appearance. This study could present the potential capacity of Streptomyces sp. F4 for Cd2++ bioremediation. © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

	abstract = {Uranium contamination is a serious concern at several sites motivating the development of novel treatment strategies such as the Geobacter-mediated reductive immobilization of uranium. However, this bioremediation strategy has not yet been optimized for the sustained uranium removal. While several reactive-transport models have been developed to represent Geobacter-mediated bioremediation of uranium, these models often lack the detailed quantitative description of the microbial process (e.g., biomass buildup in both groundwater and sediments, electron transport system, etc.) and the interaction between biogeochemical and hydrological process. In this study, a novel multi-scale model was developed by integrating our recent model on electron capacitance of Geobacter (Zhao et al., 2010) with a comprehensive simulator of coupled fluid flow, hydrologic transport, heat transfer, and biogeochemical reactions. This mechanistic reactive-transport model accurately reproduces the experimental data for the bioremediation of uranium with acetate amendment. We subsequently performed global sensitivity analysis with the reactive-transport model in order to identify the main sources of prediction uncertainty caused by synergistic effects of biological, geochemical, and hydrological processes. The proposed approach successfully captured significant contributing factors across time and space, thereby improving the structure and parameterization of the comprehensive reactive-transport model. The global sensitivity analysis also provides a potentially useful tool to evaluate uranium bioremediation strategy. The simulations suggest that under difficult environments (e.g., highly contaminated with U(VI) at a high migration rate of solutes), the efficiency of uranium removal can be improved by adding Geobacter species to the contaminated site (bioaugmentation) in conjunction with the addition of electron donor (biostimulation). The simulations also highlight the interactive effect of initial cell concentration and flow rate on U(VI) reduction. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Quickbird satellite data were acquired to relate airborne measurements to land cover features. Enhanced equivalent uranium (eU) levels were found to be confined to the mine and low grade waste rock dumps. The average terrestrial background radiation dose rate estimated from the airborne gamma survey data was 0.10-0.14 μGy h-1 while the area around the mine exhibited a maximum of ∼2.3 μGy h-1, but measurements on the ground indicate that this maximum is exceeded in some localized areas.

	abstract = {Background, aim, and scope: The subsurface at the Oak Ridge Field Research Center represents an extreme and diverse geochemical environment that places different stresses on the endogenous microbial communities, including low pH, elevated nitrate concentrations, and the occurrence of heavy metals and radionuclides, including hexavalent uranium [U(VI)]. The in situ immobilization of U(VI) in the aquifer can be achieved through microbial reduction to relatively insoluble U(IV). However, a high redox potential due to the presence of nitrate and the toxicity of heavy metals will impede this process. Our aim is to test biostimulation of the endogenous microbial communities to improve nitrate reduction and subsequent U(VI) reduction under conditions of elevated heavy metals. Materials and methods: Column experiments were used to test the possibility of using biostimulation via the addition of ethanol as a carbon source to improve nitrate reduction in the presence of elevated aqueous nickel. We subsequently analyzed the composition of the microbial communities that became established and their potential for U(VI) reduction and its in situ immobilization. Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the microbial population changed from heavy metal sensitive members of the actinobacteria, α- and γ-proteobacteria to a community dominated by heavy metal resistant (nickel, cadmium, zinc, and cobalt resistant), nitrate reducing β- and γ-proteobacteria, and sulfate reducing Clostridiaceae. Coincidentally, synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses indicated that the resulting redox conditions favored U(VI) reduction transformation to insoluble U(IV) species associated with soil minerals and biomass. Discussion: This study shows that the necessary genetic information to adapt to the implemented nickel stress resides in the endogenous microbial population present at the Oak Ridge FRC site, which changed from a community generally found under oligotrophic conditions to a community able to withstand the stress imposed by heavy metals, while efficiently reducing nitrate as electron donor. Once nitrate was reduced efficient reduction and in situ immobilization of uranium was observed. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that stimulating the metabolism of the endogenous bacterial population at the Oak Ridge FRC site by adding ethanol, a suitable carbon source, results in efficient nitrate reduction under conditions of elevated nickel, and a decrease of the redox potential such that sulfate and iron reducing bacteria are able to thrive and create conditions favorable for the reduction and in situ immobilization of uranium. Since we have found that the remediation potential resides within the endogenous microbial community, we believe it will be feasible to conduct field tests. Recommendations and perspectives: Biostimulation of endogenous bacteria provides an efficient tool for the successful in situ remediation of mixed-waste sites, particularly those co-contaminated with heavy metals, nitrate and radionuclides, as found in the United States and other countries as environmental legacies of the nuclear age. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Free-living and symbiotic fungi can interact with, and transform certain uranium species, while general metabolic activities such as decomposition of organic substances and dissolution of rocks and minerals may result in products that indirectly react with uranium. Excretion of organic acids is an important property of many fungi which can result in U-complex formation and U-ore dissolution for example, while fungal biomass can act as an efficient U biosorbent and surface/matrix for U crystallization and biomineralization. Secondary products of organic matter decomposition andmineral dissolutionmay result in secondary U-complex and Umineral formation. It is not fully established whether fungi are capable of U(VI) reductive immobilization. Fungal interactions with uranium are relevant to the biogeochemistry of uranium, but also to the applied area of bioremediation. While U biosorption seems not to have a commercial future, some fungal activities may have relevance to contaminated terrestrial habitats. The dependence of almost all land plants on symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi, and the fact that mycorrhizal fungi are capable of uranium transformations may make fungal biogeochemical activity of importance in phytoor other bioremediation strategies for soils polluted with various forms of uranium. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {On both U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and U.S. Department of Defense sites in the southwestern United States (U.S.), significant areas of surface soils are contaminated with radionuclides from atmospheric nuclear testing, and with depleted uranium, primarily from military training. At DOE sites in Nevada, the proposed regulatory closure strategy for most sites is to leave contaminants in place with administrative controls and periodic monitoring. Closure-in-place is considered an acceptable strategy because the contaminated sites exist on access-restricted facilities, decreasing the potential risk to public receptor, the high cost and feasibility of excavating contaminated soils over large areas, and the environmental impacts of excavating desert soils that recover very slowly from disturbance. The largest of the contaminated sites on the Tonopah Test Range in Nevada covers over 1,200 hectares. However, a factor that has not been fully investigated in the long-term stewardship of these sites is the potential effects of fires. Because of the long half-lives of some of the contaminants (e.g., 24,100 years for 239Pu) and changes in land-cover and climatic factors that are increasing the frequency of fires throughout the western U.S., it should be assumed that all of these sites will eventually burn, possibly multiple times, during the timeframe when they still pose a risk. Two primary factors are contributing to increased fire frequency. The first is the spread of invasive grasses, particularly cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum and Bromus rubens), which have out-competed native annuals and invaded interspaces between shrubs, allowing fires to burn easier. The second is a sharp increase in fire frequency and size throughout the western U.S. beginning in the mid-1980s. This second factor appears to correlate with an increase in average spring and summer temperatures, which may be contributing to earlier loss of soil moisture and longer periods of dry plant biomass (particularly from annual plants). The potential risk to site workers from convective heat dispersion of radionuclide contaminants is an immediate concern during a fire. Long-term, post-fire concerns include potential changes in windblown suspension properties of contaminated soil particles after fires because of loss of vegetation cover and changes in soil properties, and soil erosion from surface water runoff and fluvial processes.

To provide insight into the in situ distribution of Anaeromyxobacter strains in this system with a nonuniform groundwater flow, 16S rRNA gene-targeted primers and linear hybridization (TaqMan) probes were designed for Oak Ridge IFC Anaeromyxobacter isolates FRC-D1 and FRC-W, along with an Anaeromyxobacter genus-targeted probe and primer set. Multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (mqPCR) was applied to samples collected from Oak Ridge IFC site areas 1 and 3, which are not connected by the primary groundwater flow paths; however, transport between them through cross-plane fractures is hypothesized. Strain FRC-W accounted for more than 10% of the total quantifiable Anaeromyxobacter community in area 1 soils, while strain FRC-D1 was not detected. In FeOOH-amended enrichment cultures derived from area 1 site materials, strain FRC-D1 accounted for 30 to 90% of the total Anaeromyxobacter community, demonstrating that this strain was present in situ in area 1. The area 3 total Anaeromyxobacter abundance exceeded that of area 1 by 3 to 5 orders of magnitude, but neither strain FRC-W- nor FRC-D1-like sequences were quantifiable in any of the 33 area 3 groundwater or sediment samples tested. The Anaeromyxobacter community in area 3 increased from <105 cells/g sediment outside the ethanol biostimulation treatment zone to 108 cells/g sediment near the injection well, and 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis revealed that representatives of a novel phylogenetic cluster dominated the area 3 Anaeromyxobacter community inside the treatment loop.

This article presents a review of Kd values for uranium, radium, lead, polonium and thorium based on an extensive literature survey, including recent publications. The Kd estimates were presented per soil groups defined by their texture and organic matter content (Sand, Loam, Clay and Organic), although the texture class seemed not to significantly affect Kd.

	abstract = {The strategies developed by plants to tolerate heavy metals dictate their survival capability in contaminated places. Sometimes they accumulate significant amounts of those elements. The accumulation ability makes them capable of retaining large amounts of metals thus avoiding the dispersion of these metals and so they become natural cleaners of the environment. This effect is sometimes referred to as natural attenuation. However this environmental control is not only due to the vegetation but also to other non-biotic agents such as chemical exchanges with waters, soils and sediments. This work intends to identify what are the principal elements in the ecosystem that are responsible for the immobilisation of uranium coming from the old mine works of Urgeiriça (it was the most important uranium mine of Portugal) and which are dripping into the stream of Pantanha (near Nelas, Viseu, Centre-North of Portugal). It has been verified that the species Apium nodiflorum, Callitriche stagnalis, and Amblystegium sp accumulate large amounts of uranium, as well as the dead leafs and the finer sediments. The uranium concentration in the waters decreases from the discharge point and this concentration drops 30 times in a 3,5 km distance with no human intervention.},

	abstract = {Background, aim, and scope In Part 1 of this paper test thresholds for radionuclides in soil have been derived on the basis of methods and scales of the German Ordinance on Soil Protection (BBodSchV). In this paper, these test thresholds are checked with regard to their plausibility. Materials, methods, results are described in Part 1 of this paper. Discussion This contribution demonstrates that the test thresholds derived in Part 1 are plausible and feasible according to the requirements of the established methods. The epidemiological basis for the treatment of ionizing radiation is well founded. Risks can be quantified via the knowledge of cancer risks due to radiation. As a reference value the overall fatal risk coefficient of 5 % per Sv recommended by ICRP is used. The test thresholds obtained are sufficiently far from background levels in soils of northern Germany. Consequently, the test thresholds are applicable without any background corrections. Exposures by external radiation outdoors and exposures by inhalation of radon in cellar rooms result in calculated test thresholds in the order of background levels. Nevertheless, feasible results are obtained because in the case of toxic substances without threshold levels the additional exposures are considered for determination of test thresholds. Conclusions The approach of test thresholds for radioactive soil contamination presented in Part 1 of this paper complies with the criteria of the German methods for calculation of test thresholds in soil protection regarding plausibility and feasibility. It enables the soil protection authorities to assess radioactive contaminations of the ground according to the established rules in the field of soil protection and to make decisions according to Articles 9 and 10 of the German Soil Protection Act. Part 3 of this paper discusses the application of the test thresholds and the possibilities of determining the need for remediation actions. © Springer-Verlag 2010.},

In addition, a total of 14 heavy minerals found in the soils were characterized. The soil to plant transfer of uranium and thorium was tested on three black sand species, namely, Cakile maritima Scop., Senecio glaucus L. and Rumex Pictus Forssk. The transfer of thorium and uranium radionuclides from the soil to plant is complex process that is subjected to many variables; among which are the organic matter and clay content of the soil, the type of radionuclides and plant species. The study revealed a strong negative relationship between uranium and thorium uptake by S. glaucus and R. pictus and the clay and organic matter content of soil. Concentration of thorium in the soil has a negative correlation with soil-to-plant transfer factor. The study results suggest the possibility of using black sand species for phytoremediation of soils contaminated with radioactive elements.

	abstract = {Biological uranium reduction was investigated using bacteria isolated from a uranium mine in Limpopo, South Africa. Background uranium concentration in soil from the mine was determined to be 168 mg kg-1 much higher than the typical background uranium concentration in natural soils (0.30-11.7 mg kg-1). Therefore it was expected that the bacteria isolated from the site were resistant to U(VI) toxicity. Preliminary studies using a non-purified consortium from the mine soil showed that U(VI) [uranyl(VI) dioxide, UO22 +] was reduced and re-oxidized intermittently due to the coexistence of U(VI) reducers and U(VI) oxidisers in the soil. Results from U(VI) reduction by individual species showed that the purified cultures of Pantoea sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Enterobacter sp. reduced U(VI) to U(IV) [U(OH)4(aq)] under pH 5-6. Klebsiella sp. had to be eliminated from the cultures since these contributed to the remobilisation of uranium to the hexavelant form. The initial reduction rate determined at 50% point in 30 mg L-1 batches was highest in Pseudomonas sp. at 30 mg L-1, followed by Pantoea sp. Rapid reduction was observed in all cultures during the first 6 h of incubation with equilibrium conditions obtained only after incubation for 24 h. Complete U(VI) reduction was observed at concentrations as high as 200 mg L-1 and up to 88% removal after 24 h in batches with an initial added U(VI) concentration of 400 mg L-1. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Uranium is one of the most common radionuclides in soils, sediments, and groundwater at radionuclides-contaminated sites. At these contaminated sites, uranium leaches into the groundwater, which has become a widespread problem at mining and milling sites across North America, South America, and Eastern Europe. The movement of groundwater usually transports soluble uranium contaminants beyond their original boundaries, causing a global problem in aquifers, water supplies, and related ecosystems and posing a serious threat to human health and the natural environment. In order to meet the EPA standards, extensive efforts have been made to assess and remediate uranium-contaminated sites. As a cost-effective technology with minimal disruption to the environment, bioremediation harnessing indigenous microbial processes for cleanup has been utilized for uranium remediation. In the first part of this chapter, various uranium remediation technologies are discussed. Emphasis is placed on the principles and mechanisms of uranium bioremediation and the key factors affecting it. The second part of this chapter focuses on the use of biofilms for uranium immobilization in groundwater from subsurface environments. Most of the literature studies on uranium bioremediation have been conducted with suspended microorganisms or enriched sediments, which were eventually spiked with micro-or nano-particles of other minerals. However, biofilms are the commonly found microbial growth pattern in natural soils and water-sediment interfaces. With heterogeneous and complex biotic, abiotic and redox conditions significantly different from those in bulk conditions, biofilms pose challenges in predicting the mobility of uranium. Although previous studies have improved our understanding of uranium immobilization processes in biofilms, in order to efficiently and sustainably immobilize uranium at contaminated sites using indigenous biofilms, more knowledge is needed on the complex interactions among uranium, biofilms, and various redox-sensitive minerals during in situ uranium bioremediation. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Applications of N, P, and K suffice in general to obtain crops rich in biomass, protein, and in those trace metals which are essential for plant's and consumer's health. Whereas trace metal deficiencies in soils can be easily overcome, seriously metalliferous soils lie waste in expectance of cost-efficient remediation treatments. It was recently shown that uptake of the metalloproteid-associated transition metals, (Cd), Co, Cu. Mn, Ni, and Zn as well as Ca and Mg rises and falls near-linearly with the Norg content in dicots. Moreover, traces of phytochelants and certain amino acids in soil trigger a disproportionate uptake of selected elements (Co, Mn), while other amino compounds support dry weight and Norg formation but not the (proportionate) uptake of trace metals. Applications of trace metals to deficient soils or of the soil-N consume initiating hydrocarbons to metalliferous soils to repress Norg formation and (heavy) metal uptake synchronously are therefore not the only ways to optimize the trace metal content of crop plants. In the present study, Chinese cabbage was potted on extremely metalliferous uranium mine dump soil substrates. The original soil Corg 2.5 % (w/w) was attenuated with quartz sand (Corg = 0) to substrates Corg 0.5 and 1.55 %. It was also enriched with Fischer's commercial compost (Corg 21 %) to substrates Corg 6.6 and 9.5 %. The soil was treated in this way to lower the concentrations of hazardous elements in the soil solution by simple attenuation or by sorption to organic matter and, thus, to restrict plant uptake of heavy metals. Compost was also expected to serve as a "hydrocarbon" supplement with effects on the plant's Norg formation and metal homeostasis. Due to the largely differing mineral-N resources from sand-attenuated to the compost-amended soil substrates, dry weight production (5.5 times) and Norg content (3.3 times) of Chinese cabbage shoots varied considerably. In shoot tissues of plants from soil samples Corg 0.5 to 2.5 %, concentrations of the proteid-associated transition metals and of Ca and Mg fell and rose once more near-linearly with Norg. Uptake of certain essential and non-essential elements declined only in the case of plants from soil Corg 0.5 % with its seriously cut metal content. With the introduction of Fischer's compost, the relation between the content in shoot Norg and a proportionate uptake in the sum of the proteid-associated transition metals and in Ca and Mg was dramatically reversed, although these metals remained in solution and did not bind to the compost supplement. Shoot tissues of plants from soil samples Corg 6.6/9.5 % did not form top concentrations in Norg. They contained nevertheless as little as 28/19 % from the quantity of the five transition metals which would theoretically be taken up from non-amended soil to correspond with the quantity of Norg. Uptake of Ca and Mg was also repressed, whereas uptake of non-essential elements was almost not impaired by soil Corg and shoot Norg. Among several other sources of commercial biosolids, Zeus compost (Corg 42 %) restricted the formation of shoot Norg upon the N-consuming degradation of its inherent hexose sugars. The compost did not disrupt the proportionality between concentrations in shoot Norg and in Ca, (Cd), Mg, Ni, and Zn, whereas uptake of Co, Cu, and Mn was selectively repressed. It is concluded that soils contaminated with (Cd), Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Zn but not with other hazardous trace metals could be opened to crop production via application of certain biosolids and a restricted N supply. Crop production on trace metal deficient soils should imply the application of soil acidifying and the formation of plant protein promoting NH4 fertilizers as well as of organic N sources which are mineralized via NH3/NH4+ intermediates. Application of organic carbon should be confined. It is further concluded that changes in the plant's metal homeostasis in the presence of several composts point to a potential role of those microbial plant growth hormones which had been formed during its industrial fermentation. Compost may also serve as a hydrocarbon-like supplement with soil-N sequestration inducing and thus plant Norg and metal uptake restricting properties. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

As one of the most toxic radionuclides, uranium can disperse on soil surface by runoff, into the air by wind and to groundwater by leaching, subsequently endangering both human and animal health. Proper management of uranium-contaminated environments has therefore become an urgent need specifically in times of Nuclear Renaissance, which calls upon a holistic strategic approach from the exploitation of such natural resources, its processing in the nuclear fuel cycle to decommissioning with the appropriate considerations of environmental and radiation impacts. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

DNA from the groundwater community was analyzed with a functional gene array containing 2006 probes to detect genes involved in metal resistance, sulfate reduction, organic contaminant degradation, and carbon and nitrogen cycling. Microbial diversity decreased in relation to the contamination levels of the wells. Highly contaminated wells had lower gene diversity but greater signal intensity than the pristine well. The microbial composition was heterogeneous, with 17-70% overlap between different wells. Metal-resistant and metal-reducing microorganisms were detected in both contaminated and pristine wells, suggesting the potential for successful bioremediation of metal-contaminated groundwaters. In addition, results of Mantel tests and canonical correspondence analysis indicate that nitrate, sulfate, pH, uranium, and technetium have a significant (p < 0.05) effect on microbial community structure. This study provides an overall picture of microbial community structure in contaminated environments with functional gene arrays by showing that diversity and heterogeneity can vary greatly in relation to contamination. © 2009 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The bacterial community structure within a uranium ore was investigated using culture-dependent and -independent clone library analysis and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rRNA genes. The major aerobic heterotrophic bacteria were isolated and identified, and their resistance to uranium and other heavy metals was characterized. Together with near neutral pH, moderate organic carbon content, elevated U and other heavy metals (V, Ni, Mn, Cu, etc.), the ore showed high microbial counts and phylotype richness. The bacterial community mainly consisted of uncultured Proteobacteria, with the predominance of γ - over β - and α -subdivisions, along with Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. A phylogenetic study revealed that nearly one-third of the community was affiliated to as yet uncultured and unidentified bacteria having a closer relationship to Pseudomonas. Lineages of Burkholderiaceae and Moraxellaceae were relatively more abundant in the total community, while genera affiliated to Xanthomonadaceae and Microbacteriaceae and Exiguobacterium were detected in the culturable fraction. More than 50% of the bacterial isolates affiliated to Stenotrophomonas, Microbacterium, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and Enterobacter showed resistance to uranium and other heavy metals. The study showed for the first time that uranium ore harbors major bacterial groups related to organisms having a wide range of environmentally significant functional attributes, and the most abundant members are possibly new groups/taxa. These findings provide new insights into U-ore geomicrobiology that could be useful in biohydrometallurgy and bioremediation applications. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

In Brazil, one closed uranium mine has faced such a problem. The waste, produced during the neutralization of acid drainage and containing several metals including uranium, has been disposed into the mine opening as a temporary alternative for over 20 years. The present work aimed at the recovery of the uranium present in the aforementioned waste. The effect of the following parameters on the leaching procedure was investigated: solid/liquid ratio, time, temperature, extracting agents, concentration of reagents, and the use of oxidants. The chemical characterization showed that the main constituents of the sample are Ca, S, Mn, and Al. Uranium is around 0.25%. The crystallized phases are ettringite (Ca 6Al2(SO4)3·(OH) 12·26H2O) as the major phase followed by gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O), calcite (CaCO3), and bassanite (CaSO4·0.5H2O). Carbonate and bicarbonate were observed to be effective extractants for the uranium. However, a combination of both reagents proved to be a better option than their individual use, and extractions around 100% were achieved. The optimum experimental condition for attaining the maximum dissolution is 0.11 solid/liquid ratio, 0.50 mol L-1 Na2CO3, 1.00 mol L-1 NaHCO3, 20 h, and room temperature. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

Plants were cultivated during one month on two soils with naturally or industrially increased contaminant levels of U. Treatments with citric acid, NH4-citrate/citric acid, oxalic acid, S,S-ethylenediamine disuccinic acid (EDDS) or nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) at a rate of 5 mmol kg- 1 dry soil caused increases in soil solution concentrations that were up to 18 times higher for U and up to 1570 times higher for other heavy metals, compared to the controls. Shoot concentrations increased to a much smaller extent. With EDDS, 19-, 34-, and 37-fold increases were achieved in shoots of Indian mustard for U, Pb and Cu, respectively. The increases in plant uptake of Cd, Cr and Zn were limited to a factor of four at most. Ryegrass generally extracted less U and metals than Indian mustard. Despite a marked increase of U and metal concentrations in shoots after addition of amendments, the estimated time required to obtain an acceptable reduction in soil contaminant concentrations was impractically long. Only for Cu and Zn in one of the studied soils, could the Flemish standards for clean soil theoretically be attained in less than 100 years. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The original pilot-scale electrokinetic equipment suitable to soil contamination characteristics of Korean nuclear facility sites was manufactured for the remediation of soil contaminated with uranium. During the experiment with the original pilot-scale electrokinetic equipment, lots of metal oxides were generated and were stuck on the cathode plate. The uranium removal capability of the original pilot-scale electrokinetic equipment was almost exhausted because the cathode plate was covered with metal oxides and did not conduct electricity properly. Therefore, the original pilot-scale electrokinetic equipment was improved as follows. First, an immersion-washing device was manufactured for washing the metal oxides from the cathode plate. Second, a metal oxide separator for removal of metal oxide particles below 0.075 mm was manufactured. Third, a circulation system for pH control and waste-solution movement was manufactured. The circulation system controls the pH in the cathode room at 1-2, to prevent the generation of metal hydroxide and circulates waste-solution in a cathode room to prevent the increase of metal oxides due to its stagnancy. After the remediation experiment for 25 days using improved pilot-scale electrokinetic equipment, the removal efficiency of uranium from the soil was 96.8%, and its residual uranium concentration was 0.81 Bq/g. When the initial uranium concentration of the soil was 50 Bq/g, the electrokinetic remediation time required to remediate the uranium concentration below clearance concentration of 1.0 Bq/g was about 34 days. When the initial uranium concentration of soil was 75 Bq/g, the electrokinetic remediation time required to remediate below 1.0 Bq/g was about 42 days. When the initial uranium concentration of soil was 100 Bq/g, the electrokinetic remediation time required to remediate below 1.0 Bq/g was 49 days. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The phytoremediation of recalcitrant metals such as lead and uranium rely on soil amendments to enhance metal availability within the rhizosphere. Because these amendments may persist in soils, agents that not only biodegrade rapidly but also are effective in triggering metal uptake in plants are needed for metals phytoextraction to be considered as an accepted practice. In this study, several biodegradable organic acids and chelating agents were assessed to determine if these amendments can be used in an effective manner, and if their activity and use is consistent with a proposed class of soil amendments for phytoextraction, here termed transient phytoextraction agents (TPAs). A TPA is proposed as an agent that would exhibit both effectiveness in triggering plant accumulation of the targeted metal while minimizing the risk of migration through rapid degradation or inactivation of the soluble complex. Eleven candidate TPAs (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, citric acid, malic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid, dicarboxymethylglutamic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid, BayPure® CX 100, and the siderophore desferrioxamine B) were tested in batch studies to evaluate their complexation behavior using contaminated soils, with uranium and lead as the target metals. A growth chamber study was then conducted with Brassica juncea (Indian mustard), Helianthus annuus (sunflower), and Festuca arundinacea (tall fescue) grown in a lead-contaminated soil that was treated with the candidate TPAs to assess phytoextraction effectiveness. For the soils tested, citric acid, oxalic acid, and succinic acid were found to be effective complexing agents for uranium phytoextraction, whereas Baypure® CX 100 and citric acid exhibited effectiveness for lead phytoextraction.

	abstract = {The former production site of NUKEM where nuclear fuel-elements were developed and handled from 1958 to 1988 was situated in the centre of an industrial park for various activities of the chemical and metallurgical industry. The size of the industrially used part is about 300.000m2. Regulatory routine controls showed elevated CHC (Chlorinated Hydro-Carbons) values of the ground water at the beginning of the 1990's in an area which represented about 80.000 m2 down-gradient of locations where CHC compounds were stored and handled. Further investigations until 1998 proved that former activities on the NUKEM site, like the UF6 conversion process, were of certain relevance. The fact that several measured values were above the threshold values made the remediation of the ground water mandatory. This was addressed in the permission given by the Ministry for Nuclear Installations and Environment of Hesse according to §7 of the German atomic law in October 2000 [1]. Ground water samples taken in an area of about 5.000 m2 showed elevated values of total Uranium activity up to between 50 and 75 Bq/1 in 2002. Furthermore in an area of another 20.000m2 the samples were above threshold value. In this paper results of the remediation are presented. The actual alpha-activities of the ground waters of the remediation wells show values of 3 to 9Bq/1 which are dominated by 80 to 90 % U-234 activity. The mass-share of total Uranium for this nuclide amounts to 0,05% on average. The authority responsible for conventional water utilisation defined target values for remediation: 20μg/l for dissolved Uranium and 10μg/1 for CHC [2]. Both values have not yet been reached for an area of about 10.000 m2. The remediation process by extracting water from four remediation wells has proved its efficiency by reduction of the starting concentrations by a factor of 3 to 6. Further pumping will be necessary especially in that area of the site where the contaminations were found later during soil remediation activities. Only two wells have been in operation since July 2002 when the remediation technique was installed and an apparatus for direct gamma-spectroscopic measurement of the accumulated activities on the adsorbers was qualified. Two further remediation wells have been in operation since August 2006, when the installed remediation technique was about to be doubled from a throughput of 5 m3/h to 10 m3/h. About 20.000 m3 of ground water have been extracted since from these two wells and the decrease of their Uranium-concentrations behaves similar to that of the two other wells being extracted since the beginning of remediation. Both, total Uranium-concentrations and the weight-share of the nuclides U-234, U-235 and U-238 are measured by ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry) besides measurements of Uranium-Alpha-Activities in addition to the measurement of CHC components of which PCE (Perchlor- Ethene) is dominant in the contaminated area. CHC compounds are measured by GC (Gas Chromatography). Down-gradient naturally attenuated products are detected in various compositions. Overall 183.000m3 of ground water have been extracted. Using a pump & treat method 11 kg Uranium have been collected on an ion-exchange material based on cellulose, containing almost 100 MBq U-235 activity, and almost 15 kg of CHC, essentially PCE, were collected on GAC (Granules of Activated Carbon). Less than 3% of the extracted Uranium have passed the adsorber-system of the remediation plant and were adsorbed by the sewage sludge of the industrial site's waste water treatment. The monthly monitoring of 19 monitoring wells shows that an efficient artificial barrier was built up by the water extraction. The Uranium contamination of two ground water plumes has drastically been reduced by the used technique dependent on the amounts of extracted water. The concentration of the CHC contamination has changed depending on the location of temporal pumping. Thereby maximum availability of this contaminant for the remediation process is ensured. If locations with unchanged water quality are detected electrochemical parameters of the water or hydro-geologic data of the aquifer have to be taken into further consideration to improve the process of remediation.

	abstract = {Environmental uranium contamination based on human activity is a serious problem worldwide. Soil contaminated with uranium poses a long-term radiation hazard to human health through exposure via the food-chain and other pathways. This chapter is an overview of processes and modern techniques for remediation of soils contaminated with uranium, with special attention on phytoremediation. Phytoremediation takes advantage of plant to extract, sequester pollutants in soil, water, and air with an aim of pollutant removal and transformation into harmless forms.The objective of this chapter is to develop a better understanding of plants behavior and the degree of affinity towards the adoption of uranium for hyperaccumulators plants based on review of international research. To understand the mechanism of uranium uptake in plants and accumulation, a necessary prerequisite is the application of radiophytoremediation on the "real" scale. For this purpose, we investigated these processes using three different aspects with selected cultivated plants: 1. Vegetative tests in pots of fully controlled conditions, with corn plants that were grown on two types of soil, pseudogley and chernozem, together with its phytotoxic effect on the plant development, height, yield, and seed germination.2. Greenhouse experiments with tailings from the closed uranium mine Kalna on the southeast of Serbia. Three series of experiments were conducted in plastic-house. First, three plant species (corn, sunflower, and green peas) were grown in pots on the four substrate variants, tailings in mixture with sand. The substrate was irrigated with drinking water and "uranium water", which issues out from the mine. Another experiment was conducted in order to investigate the uptake of U in several kinds of roots-crops, bulbous, and tuberous plants: carrot, onion, potatoes, radish, red beet, and sugar beet. Content of uranium was found in leaves and roots (surface root layer and edible parts were peeled). Also we investigated uranium adoption in four genotypes of com, sunflower, and soy bean.3. Vegetation test on real, native conditions on tailings, from the closed uranium mine Kalna. The experiment was carried out on the elementary plots one square meter in size, with bean, cabbage, lettuce, com, onion, potatoes, spinach, and sunflower.Well-organized use of phytotechnology means an integrated management strategy for contaminated sites which include proper selection of plants (uranium hyperaccumulators), improving mobility of uranium with amendments (organic agents), and application sequestering agents for immobilization and transformation of excess uranium, which the plants didn't accept. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

	abstract = {Extensive copper and cobalt ore deposits can be found in the Katanga Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo near the city of Kolwezi. These deposits have been mined via open pit and underground mines since the 19th century with many changes in control of the mines including colonial industrial control and Congolese government control. With the recent re-establishment of a relatively stable democratic government in the DRC, foreign investors returned to the area to restart mining activities that were abruptly terminated in the 1990's due to political turmoil. Some of these new projects are being performed in accordance with World Bank and International Finance Corporation Social & Environmental Sustainability standards. As part of these standards, radiological characterization of the mines, processing facilities, and surrounding environment was conducted to establish current conditions, evaluate human health and ecological risks, and provide a basis for establishment of radiation safety and environmental remediation programs. In addition to naturally occurring radioactive materials associated with the copper/cobalt ore, the site was reputedly historically used to store ore from the Shinkolobwe uranium mine, the source of the uranium ore for the World War II Manhattan project. The radiological characterization was conducted via extensive gamma radiation surveys using vehicle-mounted sodiumiodide detectors, random grid composite soil sampling, biased soil sampling of areas with elevated gamma radiation levels, and sampling of surface water features. The characterization revealed broad areas of elevated gamma radiation levels of up to 160 μGy/hr in two distinct areas believed to be the Shinkolobwe uranium mine ore storage locations. Other areas, with gamma radiation levels of up to 80 μGy/hr, were detected associated with copper/cobalt ore refinery tailings and waste rock (overburden) sediments. The gamma radiation surveys revealed that elevated radiation levels were largely confined to areas previously disturbed by mechanized mining activities. Radiological contaminants in local surface water sources were within drinking water standards with the exception of one river heavily polluted with both uranium and other metals by waste streams from an ore processing and refining facility. Surrounding areas that appeared to be undisturbed by mining, including agricultural areas, native villages, and urban colonial-architecture cities, exhibited soil concentration and gamma radiation levels consistent with expected background levels. © 2009 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Bioreduction-based strategies for remediating uranium (U)-contaminated sediments face the challenge of maintaining the reduced status of U for long times. Because groundwater influxes continuously bring in oxidizing terminal electron acceptors (O2, NO3-), it is necessary to continue supplying organic carbon (OC) to maintain the reducing environment after U bioreduction is achieved. We tested the influence of OC supply rates on mobility of previously microbial reduced uranium U(IV) in contaminated sediments. We found that high degrees of U mobilization occurred when OC supply rates were high, and when the sediment still contained abundant Fe(III). Although 900 days with low levels of OC supply minimized U mobilization, the sediment redox potential increased with time as did extractable U(VI) fractions. Molecular analyses of total microbial activity demonstrated a positive correlation with OC supply and analyses of Geobacteraceae activity (RT-qPCR of 16S rRNA) indicated continued activity even when the effluent Fe(II) became undetectable. These data support our hypothesis on the mechanisms responsible for remobilization of U under reducing conditions; that microbial respiration caused increased (bi)carbonate concentration and formation of stable uranyl carbonate complexes, thereby shifted U(IV)/U(VI) equilibrium to more reducing potentials. The data also suggested that low OC concentrations could not sustain the reducing condition of the sediment for much longer time. Bioreduced U(IV) is not sustainable in an oxidizing environment for a very long time. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {One widely accepted approach - component additivity (CA) - to describe the sorption of contaminants onto complex materials such as rocks or soils is based on the assumption that the surface of a complex mineral assemblage is composed of a mixture of mineral constituents whose surface properties are known from independent studies. An internally consistent SCM (surface complexation model) database can be developed that describes the adsorption reactions of solutes to each phase. Here, the capability of such a methodology was tested, using the code MINTEQA2 including thermodynamic data of the NEA-TDB, and literature data for SCM, namely the DDL model. The sorption characteristics of U(VI) on granite (from Eibenstock, Saxony, Germany, with the main components quartz, albite, orthoclase, and muscovite) was predicted and then compared to batch experiments. Granite plays an important role in the remediation of former uranium ore mining and milling sites, but is also one of the host rocks considered for final disposal of nuclear materials. Safety assessment requires a detailed understanding of this system and its retention potential with regard to hazardous components. Namely the sorption of uranium in this complex rock is not fully understood yet. The experiments thus also provided a better understanding of the far-field behaviour in granitic geological nuclear repositories. The robustness of the prediction was tested by variation of the granite composition and the variation of the specific surface area (SSA) - first all components were predicted with a uniform granite SSA, second with a distinct SSA for each granite component (determined on pure minerals for the same grain size fractions). Changes in compositions yielded only marginal differences in the prediction. Different approaches to SSA showed somewhat larger deviations.In conclusion, the CA methodology is a valid and robust approach to U(VI) sorption onto complex substrates such as granite, provided sufficient information on component phases is available. This should help to minimize experimental efforts and to increase confidence into complex SCM computations. © by Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, München.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have shown that Geobacter sulfurreducens requires the outer-membrane, multicopper protein OmpB for Fe(III), oxide reduction. A homologue of OmpB, designated OmpC, which is 36 % similar to OmpB, has been discovered in the G. sulfurreducens genome. Deletion of ompC inhibited reduction of insoluble, but not soluble FeO(III). Analysis of multiple Geobacter and Pelobacter genomes, as well as in situ Geobacter, indicated that genes encoding multicopper proteins are conserved in Geobacter species but are not found in Pelobacter species. Levels of ompB transcripts were similar in G. sulfurreducens at different growth rates in chemostats and during growth on a microbial fuel cell anode. In contrast, ompC transcript levels increased at higher growth rates in chemostats and with increasing current production in fuel cells. Constant levels of Geobacter ompB transcripts were detected in groundwater during a field experiment in which acetate was added to the subsurface to promote in situ uranium bioremediation. In contrast, ompC transcript levels increased during the rapid phase of growth of Geobacter species following addition of acetate to the groundwater and then rapidly declined. These results demonstrate that more than one multicopper protein is required for optimal Fe(III) oxide reduction in G. sulfurreducens and suggest that, in environmental studies, quantifying OmpB/OmpC-related genes could, help alleviate the problem that Pelobacter genes may be inadvertently quantified via quantitative analysis of 16S rRNA genes. Furthermore, comparison of differential expression of ompB and ompC may provide insight into the in situ metabolic state of Geobacter species in environments of interest. © 2008 SGM.},

	abstract = {The concentrations of uranium, thorium, barium, nickel, strontium and lead in the samples of the tailings and plant species collected from a uranium mill tailings repository in South China were analyzed. Then, the removal capability of a plant for a target element was assessed. It was found that Phragmites australis had the greatest removal capabilities for uranium (820 μg), thorium (103 μg) and lead (1,870 μg). Miscanthus floridulus had the greatest removal capabilities for barium (3,730 μg) and nickel (667 μg), and Parthenocissus quinquefolia had the greatest removal capability for strontium (3,920 μg). In this study, a novel coefficient, termed as phytoremediation factor (PF), was proposed, for the first time, to assess the potential of a plant to be used in phytoremediation of a target element contaminated soil. Phragmites australis has the highest PFs for uranium (16.6), thorium (8.68), barium (10.0) and lead (10.5). Miscanthus floridulus has the highest PF for Ni (25.0). Broussonetia papyrifera and Parthenocissus quinquefolia have the relatively high PFs for strontium (28.1 and 25.4, respectively). On the basis of the definition for a hyperaccumulator, only Cyperus iria and Parthenocissus quinquefolia satisfied the criteria for hyperaccumulator of uranium (36.4 μg/g) and strontium (190 μg/g), and could be the candidates for phytoremediation of uranium and strontium contaminated soils. The results show that the PF has advantage over the hyperaccumulator in reflecting the removal capabilities of a plant for a target element, and is more adequate for assessing the potential of a plant to be used in phytoremediation than conventional method. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

An understanding of these processes is imperative to successfully predict the fate of contaminants during bioremediation scenarios. A series of flow-through sediment column experiments were performed to determine if the commencement of sulfate-reducing conditions would occur while bioavailable Fe(III) was present and to determine how the bioreduction of a contaminant (uranium) was affected by the switch from iron-dominated to sulfate-dominated reducing conditions. The results presented herein demonstrated that, under biostimulation, sulfate reduction can commence even though a significant pool of bioavailable Fe(III) is present. In addition, the rate of U(VI) reduction was not negatively affected by the commencement of sulfate-reducing conditions.

	abstract = {Phosphate-induced metal stabilization (PIMS) using apatite stabilizes uranium in situ, by chemically binding it into the new low-solubility (Ksp=10-49) phase. Uranium-phosphate-autunite is stable across a wide range of geological conditions for millions of years. A large area of contaminated soil is suitable for insitu remediation that involves minimizing the mobility of the uranium. Laboratory study was conducted to quantify different forms of apatite sequestration of uranium contaminant. The experiment was done with natural phosphate from Li- sina deposit (14.43% P2O5), with non-treated samples, phosphate concentrate samples with 34.95% P2O5 and mechanochemically activated of natural apatite. Different concentration of P2O5 in apatite, pH, reaction time, solid/liquid ratio was investigated. The concentrate at pH 5.5 for 7 days sorbed around 93,64% and nature apatite, with 14,43% P2O5, for 30 days sorbed 94.54% of the uranium from the water solution, concentration 100 μg U/ml. The results show that mineral apatite "Lisina" is very effective for the treatment of contaminated soils - in situ immobilization of U. Mechanochemical activation of natural apatite in vibration mill immobilized 85.37% of uranium in the 7-day period of acting. This research on natural apatite from the deposit "Lisina" for immobilization of uranium was the first one of this type in our country.},

This effect was stronger on the plants grown on pseudogley in comparison with those grown on chernozem. Soil properties determined the tolerance and accumulation of U in plants.

A team of 11 clean-up workers (expert members) were medically examined three times: before decontamination as a preliminary medical check-up, immediately after decontamination, and four years after cleaning up contaminated ground. Objectives: This short report presents investigations and health risk assessments of clean-up workers in radioactive decontamination operations and an assessment of the environmental health perspectives for citizens living in surrounding areas. Method: The method of initial health disorders was used, analyzing the most sensitive biological materials, such as blood cells or chromosome damage, DNA strand breaks, radio-toxicological examination of urine. Results: The total number of blood cells did not change, but variations of the relative number (percentage) of cells in the leukocyte formula were observed. The total number of DNA alterations was higher immediately after decontamination than before decontamination. Four years after decontamination the number of DNA alterations had decreased. However, the number of damaged cells (lymphocytes containing chromosome lesions) was higher in both medical examinations, immediately after and four years after decontamination. Conclusions: Disease or tumours due to 238U did not develop in the group of depleted uranium clean-up workers during the investigation period of four years. Further monitoring of haematological and chromosomal effects and the health condition of workers is necessary.},

The degraded tailing ponds have been capped with 30 cm. thick soil cover. For cosolidation of radioactivity in the tailings firstly the selected plant species should not have any socioeconomic relevance in that area and secondly, uptake of uranium by selected plants has to be low to avoid its dissemination in any form in environment. Seven native plant species of forestry origin were used for experimental trials. Above ground growth has been measured for two years under ex- situ and in- situ conditions. Distribution and concentration of uranium have been evaluated in tailing pond soil as well as tailings. Uranium uptake by plants has been evaluated and discussed in this paper. The highest concentration of uranium has been found in the order as: in tailings > soil cover on tailings > roots of selected plant species > shoots of all the selected species. These results show that among seven species tried Jatropha gossypifolia and Furcraea foetida have lowest uptake (below detectable limit), while Saccharum spontaneum and Pogostemon benghalense have comparatively higher uptake among the studied species.},

	abstract = {Previous experiments at the Rifle, Colorado Integrated Field Research Challenge (IFRC) site demonstrated that field-scale addition of acetate to groundwater reduced the ambient soluble uranium concentration. In this report, sediment samples collected before and after acetate field addition were used to assess the active microbes via 13C acetate stable isotope probing on 3 phases [coarse sand, fines (8-approximately 150 μm), groundwater (0.2-8 μm)] over a 24-day time frame. TRFLP results generally indicated a stronger signal in 13C-DNA in the "fines" fraction compared to the sand and groundwater. Before the field-scale acetate addition, a Geobacter-like group primarily synthesized 13C-DNA in the groundwater phase, an alpha Proteobacterium primarily grew on the fines/sands, and an Acinetobacter sp. and Decholoromonas-like OTU utilized much of the 13C acetate in both groundwater and particle-associated phases. At the termination of the field-scale acetate addition, the Geobacter-like species was active on the solid phases rather than the groundwater, while the other bacterial groups had very reduced newly synthesized DNA signal. These findings will help to delineate the acetate utilization patterns of bacteria in the field and can lead to improved methods for stimulating distinct microbial populations in situ. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Bioremediation of uranium was investigated in microcosm experiments containing contaminated sediments from Oak Ridge, Tennessee to explore the importance of electron donor selection for uranium reduction rate and extent. In these experiments, all of the electron donors, including ethanol, glucose, methanol, and methanol with added humic acids, stimulated the reduction and immobilization of aqueous uranium by the indigenous microbial community. Uranium loss from solution began after the completion of nitrate reduction but essentially concurrent with sulfate reduction. When electron donor concentrations were normalized for their equivalent electron donor potential yield, the rates of uranium reduction were nearly equivalent for all treatments (0.55-0.95 μmol L-1 d-1). Uranium reduction with methanol proceeded after a 15-d longer lag time relative to that of ethanol or glucose. Significant differences were not found with the inclusion of humic acids. The extent of U reduction in sediment slurries measured by XANES at various time periods after the start of the experiment increased in the order of ethanol (5-7% reduced at 77 and 153 d), glucose (49% reduced at 53 d), and methanol (93% reduced at 90 d). The microbial diversity of ethanol- and methanol-amended microcosms in their late stage of U reduction was analyzed with 16S rRNA gene amplification. Members of the Geobacteraceae were found in all microcosms as well as other potential uranium-reducing organisms, such as Clostridium and Desulfosporosinus. The effectiveness of methanol relative to ethanol at reducing aqueous and sediment-hosted uranium suggests that bioremediation strategies that encourage fermentative poising of the subsurface to a lower redox potential may be more effective for long-term uranium immobilization as compared with selecting an electron donor that is efficiently metabolized by known uranium-reducing microorganisms.

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop and validate a simple, field-portable, microarray system for monitoring microbial community structure and dynamics in groundwater and subsurface environments, using samples representing site status before acetate injection, during Fe-reduction, in the transition from Fe- to SO42--reduction, and into the SO42--reduction phase. Limits of detection for the array are approximately 102-103 cell equivalents of DNA per reaction. Sample-to-answer results for the field deployment were obtained in 4 h. Retrospective analysis of 50 samples showed the expected progression of microbial signatures from Fe- to SO42- -reducers with changes in acetate amendment and in situ field conditions. The microarray response for Geobacter was highly correlated with qPCR for the same target gene (R2 = 0.84). Microarray results were in concordance with quantitative PCR data, aqueous chemistry, site lithology, and the expected microbial community response, indicating that the field-portable microarray is an accurate indicator of microbial presence and response to in situ remediation of a uranium-contaminated site. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

In this study, a uranium-contaminated soil was extracted with carbonate/ bicarbonate at varying concentrations (0-1 M), pHs, and redox conditions in an attempt to evaluate their effects on the extraction efficiency and selectivity for various forms of uranium in the soil. Results indicate that at least three different forms of uranium existed in the contaminated soil: uranium(VI) phosphate minerals, reduced U(IV) phases, and U(VI) complexed with soil organic matter. A small fraction of U(VI) could be sorbed onto soil minerals. The mechanism involved in the leaching of U(VI) by carbonates appears to involve three processes which may act concurrently or independently: the dissolution of uranium-(VI) phosphate and other mineral phases, the oxidation-complexation of U(IV) under oxic conditions, and the desorption of U(VI)-organic matter complexes at elevated pH conditions. This study suggests that, depending on site-specific geochemical conditions, the presence of small quantities of carbonate/bicarbonate could result in a rapid and greatly increased leaching and the mobilization of U(VI) from the contaminated soil. Even the reduced U(IV) phases (only sparingly soluble in water) are subjected to rapid oxidation and therefore potential leaching into the environment. © 2005 American Chemical Society.},

Homes above 140 square meters (1500 square feet) in size did not have a significantly higher chunce of having a radon level above 4 pCi/l than did homes below 140 square meters in area. Also, the depth to the Chattanooga Shale, a suspected source of radon, did not have a significant impact on the measured levels.

This population of LLW is known as legacy LLW based on its generation time frame of 1970 through 2000. Bechtel Jacobs Company, LLC was awarded an Oak Ridge Accelerated Cleanup Project that includes the characterization, processing, and disposal of the 1.2 million cubic feet of legacy LLW. The legacy LLW encompasses wastes from several generation facilities and organizations, within various container types, containing a wide range of radiological isotopes, and a blend of matrixes, each presenting a unique challenge in completion of disposal by September 30, 2005. The characterization results identified the presence of free liquids and the potential for free liquids stratification within several matrixes in the legacy LLW inventory comprised of soils, sludges, treatment residues, resins, and trapping materials. As a result of these findings, Bechtel Jacobs, WESKEM, and MHF Logistical Solutions, Inc. collaborated on the disposition strategy and designed a unique transportation technique that was employed to ensure that the high moisture content wastes were safely and compliantly transported within the time allocated under the Accelerated Cleanup Project.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that Geobacter species can effectively remove uranium from contaminated groundwater by reducing soluble U(VI) to the relatively insoluble U(IV) with organic compounds serving as the electron donor. Studies were conducted to determine whether electrodes might serve as an alternative electron donor for U(VI) reduction by a pure culture of Geobacter sulfurreducens and microorganisms in uranium-contaminated sediments. Electrodes poised at -500 mV (vs a Ag/AgCl reference) rapidly removed U(VI) from solution in the absence of cells. However, when the poise at the electrode was removed, all of the U(VI) returned to solution, demonstrating that the electrode did not reduce U(VI). If G. sulfurreducens was present on the electrode, U(VI) did not return to solution until the electrode was exposed to dissolved oxygen. This suggests that G. sulfurreducens on the electrode reduced U(VI) to U(IV) which was stably precipitated until reoxidized in the presence of oxygen. When an electrode was placed in uranium-contaminated subsurface sediments, U(VI) was removed and recovered from groundwater using poised electrodes. Electrodes emplaced in flow-through columns of uranium-contaminated sediments readily removed U(VI) from the groundwater, and 87% of the uranium that had been removed was recovered from the electrode surface after the electrode was pulled from the sediments. These results suggest that microorganisms can use electrons derived from electrodes to reduce U(VI) and that it may be possible to remove and recover uranium from contaminated groundwater with poised electrodes. © 2005 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {A treatability study for implementation of a thermally enhanced environmental remediation technique has recently been completed at a Department of Energy uranium enrichment facility in Paducah, KY. The contaminated groundwater plume beneath the site, containing primarily trichloroethylene (TCE) and technetium-99, is one of the largest-ever documented plumes, encompassing some quarter of a billion m 3 of contaminated water (10 billion gal). Various remediation technologies have been applied at the plant site over the past 15 years with moderate degrees of success. The presence of dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) in the groundwater are believed to be one of the major sources of TCE feeding the contaminated plume. Recovery/remediation of these DNAPLs was attempted in a small-scale study with a soil-heating technique called six-phase soil heating. This technology uses buried resistive heating probes to heat the soil and associated liquids upward to 125° C to literally vaporize the TCE solvent. Vacuum recovery wells are used to direct solvent/water vapor flow to the surface for recovery. At the end of the test period, soil and groundwater samples were compared to baseline (pretreatment) samples. This comparison indicated an average TCE concentration reduction in soil of 98% and greater than 99% reduction in TCE concentrations in groundwater within the test cell. Two- and 4-week posttreatment groundwater samples within the test cell have shown a slight fluctuating increase from end-of-test results, but all samples collected at various well depths indicate greater than 98% reduction in TCE concentration. Monitoring well data indicates six-phase soil heating technology was effective in extracting solvent DNAPLs rather than merely relocating them. Results of this treatability study were judged to be favorable and a full-scale implementation at the site has been recommended. © 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog.},

Hydrogeochemical analyses of sediments, plants, surface and pore waters from selected small-sized wetlands show that U is predominantly accumulated in an environment where sulfate reduction is insignificant. From soil sequential extraction it is known that the bulk of U is retained in moderately labile forms, predominantly as organically bound or acid soluble phases ("specifically adsorbed"). Uranium could be, identified by SEM/EDX, indicating that biosorption of U as cation or complex is important. However, the highest U concentrations prevail in Al-rich, inorganic agglomerates of colloidal phases. These agglomerates are as well very often non-specifically adsorbed to organic matter (plant debris, microorganisms) in the soils, promoting indirect biosorption of U. © 2007 Trans Tech Publications.},

	abstract = {A 33-amino acid peptide corresponding to the helix-turn-helix motif of the calcium binding site I of Paramecium tetraurelia calmodulin has been synthesized and its binding loop stabilized by a specific disulphide bond. Analysed by electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS), circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence, such a cyclic peptide is found to bind calcium, cadmium, terbium and europium ions with native-like affinity, and with 30±1 μM and 8±4 μM dissociation constants for calcium and cadmium ions, respectively. Metal binding induces an ordered conformation in the peptide, resembling that of the calmodulin site I. Interestingly, uranium, in the uranyl form, binds this peptide, as revealed by ES-MS, CD and fluorescence spectroscopy. Sequence mutation aiming to increase the binding cavity suppresses binding of calcium, cadmium and uranium ions, but preserves binding of lanthanide ions, showing that metal selectivity can be modulated by specific mutation in the binding loop. Such disulphide-stabilized peptide may represent a useful model to engineer new metal specificity in calmodulin variants. These novel proteins may be useful in the development of new biosensors to monitor metal pollution and to augment metal binding capability of bacterial and plant cells that can be used in biosorption techniques to (bio)remediate soils and waters contaminated by heavy metals. © 2005 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In this study, we investigated whether phosphate biomineralization, or the aerobic precipitation of U(VI)-phosphate phases facilitated by the enzymatic activities of microorganisms, offers an alternative to the more extensively studied anaerobic U(VI) bioreduction. Three heterotrophic bacteria isolated from FRC soils were studied for their ability to grow and liberate phosphate in the presence of U(VI) and an organophosphate between pH 4.5 and 7.0. The objectives were to determine whether the strains hydrolyzed sufficient phosphate to precipitate uranium, to determine whether low pH might have an effect on U(VI) precipitation, and to identify the uranium solid phase formed during biomineralization. Two bacterial strains hydrolyzed sufficient organophosphate to precipitate 73-95% total uranium after 120 h of incubation in simulated groundwater. The highest rates of uranium precipitation and phosphatase activity were observed between pH 5.0 and 7.0. EXAFS spectra identified the uranyl phosphate precipitate as an autunite/meta-autunite group mineral. The results of this study indicate that aerobic heterotrophic bacteria within a uranium-contaminated environment that can hydrolyze organophosphate, especially in low pH conditions, may play an important role in the bioremediation of uranium. © 2007 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Inactive or abandoned mines represent a significant source of environmental, chemical, physical, and aesthetic impact. Among concerning situations, the occurrence of abandoned or semi-abandoned mine-associated ponds (for sedimentation of solids, for effluent neutralization, or for washing the ore) is a common feature in this type of system. These ponds are a source of contamination for the groundwater resources and adjacent soils, because they lack appropriate impermeabilization. The use of this water for agriculture may also pose chronic risks to humans. In Portugal, these problems have been diagnosed and some remediation projects have been developed. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the acute and chronic toxicity of water samples collected from the aquatic system surrounding an abandoned uranium mine (Cunha Baixa, Mangualde, Central Portugal). The present study focuses on the water compartment, whose toxicity was evaluated by means of standard toxicity assays using two Daphnia species (D. longispina and D. magna). Three different ponds were used in the characterization of the aquatic system from Cunha Baixa mine: a reference pond (Ref), a mine effluent treatment pond (T), and a mine pit pond (M). Metal analyses performed in the water samples from these ponds showed values that, in some cases, were much higher than maximum recommendable values established (especially Al, Mn) by Portuguese legislation for waters for crop irrigation. Acute toxicity was only observed in the mine pit pond, with EC 50 values of 28.4% and 50.4% for D. longispina and D. magna, respectively. The significant impairment of chronic endpoints, translated in reductions in the population growth rate for both species, gives rise to concerns regarding the potential risks for aquatic zooplanktonic communities, from local receiving waters, potentially exposed to point source discharges of the treated and nontreated effluent from Cunha Baixa uranium mine. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {In aerobic environments, uranium is generally found in the hexavalent oxidation state, is quite soluble, and readily forms complexes with calcium and carbonate. However, under anaerobic conditions, common metal respiring bacteria can enzymatically reduce U(VI) to U(IV), resulting in the formation of sparingly soluble UO2 (uraninite). Uranium(VI) reduction, therefore, has a prominent role in natural attenuation of uranium and is being explored as a potential remediation option for this hazardous element. The stability of biologically precipitated uraninite is critical for determining the long-term fate of uranium and is not well characterized within soils and sediments. Given their environmental predominance, Fe(III) (hydr)oxides, which act as both U(VI) reductants and U(IV) oxidants, exert a prominent role in determining uranium chemical fate and associated mobility. Here, we examine several factors controlling the extent of uraninite oxidation by Fe(III) (hydr)oxides, including iron oxide and bicarbonate concentration, in addition to iron oxide type. Our analysis reveals that the extent of uraninite oxidation increases under conditions that increase the thermodynamic probability of the reaction; however, recrystallization of poorly crystalline Fe(III) (hydr)oxides to more crystalline forms may ultimately limit the uraninite oxidation reaction. Nevertheless, uraninite oxidation by Fe(III) (hydr)oxides may be a limiting factor on uraninite stability in the environment. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Subterranean clover and barley were grown on a soil derived from uranium mining debris and fertilized with phosphate as a U immobilizing additive for in situ remediation. We investigated the beneficial effect of P fertilization in the range 0-500 mg P kg-1 soil in terms of U extractability, plant biomass production and U uptake. Increasing P in the mining debris caused a significant decrease of the water-soluble U and NH4-Ac extractable U at pH 7 and 5. For both plant species, P fertilization considerably increased root and shoot dry matter up to a maximum observed for soil receiving 100 mg P kg-1 while the soil-to-plant transfer of U was regularly decreased by increasing P content in soil. These observations show that P fertilization represents an in situ practical option to facilitate the revegetation of U-mining heaps and to reduce the risks of biota exposure to U contamination. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The concentration of metals in microbial habitats influenced by mining operations can reach enormous values. Worldwide, much emphasis is placed on the research of resistance and biosorptive capacities of microorganisms suitable for bioremediation purposes. Using a collection of isolates from a former uranium mining area in Eastern Thuringia, Germany, this study presents three Gram-positive bacterial strains with distinct metal tolerances. These strains were identified as members of the genera Bacillus, Micrococcus and Streptomyces. Acid mine drainage (AMD) originating from the same mining area is characterized by high metal concentrations of a broad range of elements and a very low pH. AMD was analyzed and used as incubation solution. The sorption of rare earth elements (REE), aluminum, cobalt, copper, manganese, nickel, strontium, and uranium through selected strains was studied during a time course of four weeks. Biosorption was investigated after one hour, one week and four weeks by analyzing the concentrations of metals in supernatant and biomass. Additionally, dead biomass was investigated after four weeks of incubation. The maximum of metal removal was reached after one week. Up to 80% of both Al and Cu, and more than 60% of U was shown to be removed from the solution. High concentrations of metals could be bound to the biomass, as for example 2.2 mg/g U. The strains could survive four weeks of incubation. Distinct and different patterns of rare earth elements of the inoculated and non-inoculated AMD water were observed. Changes in REE patterns hint at different binding types of heavy metals regarding incubation time and metabolic activity of the cells. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.},

	abstract = {Protection of the environment post-mining is an important issue, especially where runoff and erosion can lead to undesirable material leaving post-mining landscapes and contaminating surrounding land and watercourses. Methods for assessment of the environmental impact and long-term behaviour of post-mining landforms based on scientific methodology are needed especially where field data are absent or poor. An appraisal of the former Nabarlek uranium mine was conducted to assess the site from a soil erosion perspective as part of an independent evaluation of overall rehabilitation success. Determination of the gross erosion occurring, sediment discharge to Cooper Creek and the resultant sediment associated radionuclide load in Cooper Creek were the primary objectives of the study. These objectives were achieved through the application of several models using parameter values collected from the site. The study found that the area containing the mill tailings repository is extremely stable and meets the guidelines established for long-term storage of uranium mill tailings. Most other areas on the site are stable; however there are some areas with a high sediment loss. Sediment concentration in Cooper Creek, which drains the site, was found to be within the Australian water quality guidelines for fresh water, however sediment concentrations in tributaries were found to exceed recommended levels. Radionuclide determinations on soil samples showed that the highest specific activities (Bq kg-1) were present on a small (0.44 ha) area with a relatively high erosion rate. This small area contributed the majority of the estimated flux to Cooper Creek of uranium-series radionuclides sorbed or structurally incorporated to eroded soil particles sourced from the mine site. This study provides a methodology for assessment of the erosional stability of such a landscape and consequent impact on water quality, using extensive field data and readily available and well known models and methodologies.},

	abstract = {A glasshouse experiment was conducted to investigate U and As accumulation by Chinese brake fern, Pteris vittata L., in association with different arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) from a U and As contaminated soil. The soil used contains 111 mg U kg-1 and 106 mg As kg-1. P. vittata L. was inoculated with each of three AMF, Glomus mosseae, Glomus caledonium and Glomus intraradices. Two harvests were made during plant growth (two and three months after transplanting). Mycorrhizal colonization depressed plant growth particularly at the early stages. TF (transfer factor) values for As from soil to fronds were higher than 1.0, while those for roots were much lower. Despite the growth depressions, AM colonization had no effect on tissue As concentrations. Conversely, TF values for U were much higher for roots than for fronds, indicating that only very small fraction of U was translocated to fronds (less than 2%), regardless of mycorrhizal colonization. Mycorrhizal colonization significantly increased root U concentrations at both harvests. Root colonization with G. mosseae or G. intraradices led to an increase in TF values for U from 7 (non-inoculation control) to 14 at the first harvest. The highest U concentration of 1574 mg kg-1 was recorded in roots colonized by G. mosseae at the second harvest. The results suggested that P. vittata in combination with appropriate AMF would play very important roles in bioremediation of contaminated environments characterized by a multi-pollution. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {This chapter focuses on the solubility and environmental remediation of the apatite group of minerals. Remediation processes based on chemical treatments destroy contaminants or convert them into less environmentally hazardous forms. The apatite group minerals are hexagonal or pseudohexagonal monoclinic arsenates, phosphates, and vanadates of the general formula A5(XO4)3Z, where A = Ba, Ca, Ce, K, Na, Pb, Sr, and Y; X = As, P, Si, and V; and Z = F, Cl, O, OH, and H2O. Solids belonging to the apatite group have been investigated as host materials for long-term immobilization of a large number of stable and radioactive elements including cadmium, copper, lead, nickel, uranium, zinc, iodide, and bromide. The apatite group of minerals displays a large solubility range, with calcium-bearing species being more soluble than their lead analogues. In situ metal immobilization employing phosphate is a cost-effective and environment-friendly technique of less disruptive nature than other remediation techniques such as soil removal, washing, or leaching. The treatment of waters with calcium oxide or hydroxide can also precipitate dissolved arsenate. To attain a total dissolved arsenic level lower than the maximum permissible concentration for total arsenic in potable water (0.010 mg/L arsenic), it is necessary to have a pH higher than 12.5, which poses other environmental problems. Under these conditions, calcium carbonate is thermodynamically stable in the solid phase if ambient surface conditions are maintained. Transformation of calcium arsenates into calcium carbonate re-releases arsenic into the environment. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Flow-through sediment column experiments examined the reoxidation of microbially reduced uranium with either oxygen or nitrate supplied as the oxidant. The uranium was reduced and immobilized via long-term (70 days) acetate biostimulation resulting in 62-92% removal efficiency of the 20 μM influent uranium concentration. Uranium reduction occurred simultaneously with iron reduction as the dominant electron accepting process. The columns were reoxidized by discontinuing the supply of acetate and either replacing the anaerobic gas used to purge the influent media with a gas mixture containing 20% oxygen (resulting in a dissolved oxygen concentration of 0.27 mM) or adding 1.6 mM nitrate to the influent media. Both oxygen and nitrate resolubilized the majority (88 and 97%, respectively) of the uranium precipitated during bioreduction within 54 days. Although oxygen is more thermodynamically favorable an oxidant than nitrate, nitrate-dependent uranium oxidation occurred significantly faster than oxygen-dependent uranium oxidation at the beginning of our experiment due, in part, to oxygen reacting more strongly with other reduced compounds. Nitrate breakthrough at the effluent of the column occurred within 12 h, which was significantly earlier than when oxygen was detected at the effluent (26 days). Although, over time, the majority of uranium was reoxidized by either oxidant, these results indicate that the type of oxidant and its reactivity with other reduced compounds will influence the fate of reduced uranium during a short-term oxidation event that may occur during a uranium bioremediation scenario. © 2007 American Chemical Society.},

Some, groundwater uranium concentrations exceeded 7 ppm while vanadium and molybdenum concentrations reached almost one ppm. The bioleaching appeared to be most effective under methanogenic conditions and was noted in both high sulfidc and low sulfide environments. Background concentrations of uranium in the formation were measured between 6 ppm and 109 ppm and highly dependent upon depth with the highest levels being found in association with evaporites. Unlike uranium, vanadium tended to concentrate in free-floating organic fractions reaching levels as high as 2000 ppm in the layers of jet fuel floating above the groundwater.

	abstract = {A bacterial isolate, designated strain SZ, was obtained from noncontaminated creek sediment microcosms based on its ability to derive energy from acetate oxidation coupled to tetrachloroethene (PCE)-to-cis-1,2- dichloroethene (cis-DCE) dechlorination (i.e., chlororespiration). Hydrogen and pyruvate served as alternate electron donors for strain SZ, and the range of electron acceptors included (reduced products are given in brackets) PCE and trichloroethene [cis-DCE], nitrate [ammonium], fumarate [succinate], Fe(III) [Fe(II)], malate [succinate], Mn(IV) [Mn(II)], U(VI) [U(IV)], and elemental sulfur [sulfide]. PCE and soluble Fe(III) (as ferric citrate) were reduced at rates of 56.5 and 164 nmol min-1 mg of protein-1, respectively, with acetate as the electron donor. Alternate electron acceptors, such as U(VI) and nitrate, did not inhibit PCE dechlorination and were consumed concomitantly. With PCE, Fe(III) (as ferric citrate), and nitrate as electron acceptors, H2 was consumed to threshold concentrations of 0.08 ± 0.03 nM, 0.16 ± 0.07 nM, and 0.5 ± 0.06 nM, respectively, and acetate was consumed to 3.0 ± 2.1 nM, 1.2 ± 0.5 nM, and 3.6 ± 0.25 nM, respectively. Apparently, electron acceptor-specific acetate consumption threshold concentrations exist, suggesting that similar to the hydrogen threshold model, the measurement of acetate threshold concentrations offers an additional diagnostic tool to delineate terminal electron-accepting processes in anaerobic subsurface environments. Genetic and phenotypic analyses classify strain SZ as the type strain of the new species, Geobacter lovleyi sp. nov., with Geobacter (formerly Trichlorobacter) thiogenes as the closest relative. Furthermore, the analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences recovered from PCE-dechlorinating consortia and chloroethene-contaminated subsurface environments suggests that Geobacter lovleyi belongs to a distinct, dechlorinating clade within the metal-reducing Geobacter group. Substrate versatility, consumption of electron donors to low threshold concentrations, and simultaneous reduction of electron acceptors suggest that strain SZ-type organisms have desirable characteristics for bioremediation applications.

	abstract = {We determined the uranium distribution in soil and its allocation in compartments of 35-year-old Scots pine developed on a revegetated U-mining heap. The processes controlling the dynamics of U recycling were identified and further quantified in terms of annual fluxes. As pine developed, an acid humus layer emerged leading to weathering of the alkaline mining debris but this had little effect on U mobility in the soil profile. Increased U mobility mainly involved a translocation of U to metal-humus chelates in surface layers. The root compartment accounted for 99.3% of the U budget in tree, thus serving as an effective barrier which restricts U uptake. The current root uptake and transfer of U to upper parts of the tree amounted to about 3 g ha-1 y-1, i.e. less than 0.03% of the current NH4-exchangeable U pool in the soil (0-30 cm). Allocation and translocation pattern made it clear that a dominant fraction of the translocated U moves passively with the ascent xylem sap, most likely as a soluble complex, and steadily accumulates in the needles. Consequently, 97% of the U annual uptake is returned to the soil through litterfall. At the studied site, the risk of U dissemination due to biomass turnover or trunk harvest was low when considered in relation to the current "exemption level" for U. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Remediation of uranium mine overburden and an acidic mine pond at the White King-Lucky Lass mines near Lakeview, Oregon was completed in November 2006. The site was remediated under Superfund due to risk from arsenic and radium-226 in overburden soils. Separate clean-up standards were developed for each mine site for arsenic and radium-226 due to differing ore-body geochemistry. Gamma surveys were used to identify overburden with elevated radium-226 activities and to provide confirmation of visual clean-up of materials. Because arsenic is collocated with radium-226 at the White King mine, gamma surveys reduced the number of arsenic confirmation samples. Secular equilibrium in the uranium-238 decay series was used to determine the extent of leaching of uranium-238 and daughter products from overburden to groundwater. Trilinear geochemical analysis distinguished mineralized groundwater within the ore bodies from regional groundwater and detected any influence from seepage from overburden piles. Remedial actions include neutralization of an acidic mine pond and consolidation of elevated-activity overburden into a pile with a soil/rock cover at White King mine. Ecological toxicity studies determined that neutralization of the pond would provide a benthic community supportive of aquatic wildlife. An overburden pile at the Lucky Lass mine and disturbed areas were covered with clean soil. The remedial actions comply with State of Oregon siting regulations, which required removal of radioactive overburden from the 500-year flood plain. Protection of human health is assured by institutional controls to prevent use of mineralized groundwater and by fencing to prevent site access. © 2007 The Geological Society of America.

	abstract = {The exploitation of natural resources containing naturally occurring radionuclides may lead to enhanced levels of radioactive isotope and enhanced potential for exposure to naturally occurring radionuclides in products, by-products, residues or wastes. Such resources include, for instance, monazite, the processing of which, in Brazil, generated a great amount of radioactive residues, being stored in buried concrete tanks, in temporary storage buildings and in sealed trenches. In addition, during the 1980s there were no radiological protection rules concerning the storage and transportation of these kinds of residues. Mineral radioactive residues were used as landfills and the residues of chemical processes contaminated floors and buildings. The decommissioning process and cleaning of old plants have generated tons of wastes that has been added to previously produced wastes. This paper reports and discusses the cycle of monazite in Brazil and its consequences in terms of site remediation and amount of wastes and residues generated and stored. © The Author 2005.

	abstract = {Chemical analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) microanalysis were carried out on cores of contaminated geological material collected around four closed waste disposal ponds to examine the extent of nitric acid extractable U (UNA) association with P, S, and extractable Fe, Al, and Mn oxides within deeply weathered fractured shale. The solid phase in many regimes on the site has been exposed to highly buffered acidic (<3.5) groundwater and has been aggressively weathered. Higher correlations occur between UNA and total P and S (r2 = 0.76, 0.69, respectively), citrate bicarbonate dithionite extractable Fe (Fed) and Al (Ald) (r2=0.87, 0.80, respectively), and acid oxalate extractable or amorphous/poorly crystalline Fe (Feo) (r2=0.63) in core material from a field plot known as Area 1 compared to core material from another field plot known as Area 3. In Area 3 core material, linear regression analysis of UNA and total P and S, and Fed, Ald and Feo gave r2 values of 0.67, 0.4, 0.06, 0.24, and 0.45, respectively. These results showed similar relationships with SEM-wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) mapping of this material. It is noteworthy that Area 1 geological material has not been as aggressively weathered as Area 3 material due to its physical location from the waste source. In all of the cores, most of the Fe and Al oxides were crystalline, while most of the Mn oxides were amorphous. The greater adsorption and/or fixation of anion complexes of P-U (uranium phosphate) and S onto Fe and Al oxides from Area 1 cores compared to Area 3 core material is probably due to a higher amount of crystalline Fe and Al oxides compared to amorphous Fe and Al oxides and higher Al substitution in Fe oxides in Area 1. This unique study illustrates the relationships between UNA, total P and S, and Al, Fe and Mn oxides in fractured shale under field conditions which can be used in planning remediation of this site and other similar sites. © 2007 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {An AMF infectivity study and spore viability assessment was performed on substrata obtained from gold and uranium mine tailings dumps ('slimes dams') in the North West and Free State provinces of South Africa. Three slimes dams in each region were categorized as recently vegetated (RV), old vegetated (OV) and never vegetated (NV), and dams then divided into five zones based on elevation above ground level, steepness and broad chemical differences. Rhizosphere samples were collected from two of three plant species common to all sites; Eragrostis curvula, Atriplex semibaccata and Cynodon dactylon, as well as from bare areas, in order to allow comparisons across all site categories because of the rarity of the grasses on the lower slope of NV dams. Infectivity was determined by the mean infection percentage method from a bioassay of the substrata using Eragrostis curvula cv Ermelo as a host plant. There was no difference in total infectivity between North West and Free State substrata, but within regions, there were differences in infectivity between rehabilitation ages, between zones, and between rhizosphere and bare areas. Toepaddock substrata and veld soil produced the highest total infection levels overall. On both dams and veld, total arbuscular levels differed between rhizosphere and bare substrata, and the percentage of arbuscules (max. 15.4%) and vesicles (max. 22.0%) as a proportion of total infection structures was low. A low correlation between infectivity and total spore numbers was also found. Spore numbers and the numbers of viable spores increased with zone down the slimes dams to the veld, and also differed within zones between rhizosphere and bare substrata with marked interactive effects. Substratum organic matter (SOM) levels differed between regions, and between zones within the North West region increasing with distance down the slopes to the veld, and were strongly correlated with total spore numbers. Substratum pH values and most AMF parameters were positively correlated in the order of RV > OV > NV dams, indicating that natural colonization of acidic NV sites by AMF is at very low rates, and that AMF colonizing RV slopes are not surviving the transition from RV to OV, with the associated increase in acidity, conductivity and decline in plant cover. Substratum conductivity differed between zones in both regions, with minor interaction between region and zone, and was negatively correlated with pH, AMF infectivity and total spore numbers. Our findings demonstrate that the ameliorant effects of liming and irrigation on substratum pH and conductivity are short-lived, but despite the physico-chemical constraints, a significant measurable AMF inoculum potential does exist on all substrata. Amelioration of tailings with organic matter and use of acid and salt-tolerant AMF would be expected to contribute to more persistent AMF communities and vegetation on gold and uranium slimes dams. © 2007 SAAB.},

	abstract = {Here, we report a catalytic beacon sensor for uranyl (UO2 2+) based on an in vitro-selected UO22+- specific DNAzyme. The sensor consists of a DNA enzyme strand with a 3′ quencher and a DNA substrate with a ribonucleotide adenosine (rA) in the middle and a fluorophore and a quencher at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The presence of UO22+ causes catalytic cleavage of the DNA substrate strand at the rA position and release of the fluorophore and thus dramatic increase of fluorescence intensity. The sensor has a detection limit of 11 parts per trillion (45 pM), a dynamic range up to 400 nM, and selectivity of >1-million-fold over other metal ions. The most interfering metal ion, Th(IV), interacts with the fluorescein fluorophore, causing slightly enhanced fluorescence intensity, with an apparent dissociation constant of ≈230 μM. This sensor rivals the most sensitive analytical instruments for uranium detection, and its application in detecting uranium in contaminated soil samples is also demonstrated. This work shows that simple, cost-effective, and portable metal sensors can be obtained with similar sensitivity and selectivity as much more expensive and sophisticated analytical instruments. Such a sensor will play an important role in environmental remediation of radionuclides such as uranium. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

	abstract = {A phytoremediation study was performed on the area of the old uranium mill tailings waste depot of a former uranium ore reprocessing factory in South Bohemia. The distribution of 226Ra in contaminated soil was found to be extremely variable (from 7 to 32 Bq 226Ra/g of DW). No direct relation was proved between plant species characteristics and their radioactivity content. The results showed a great range of variation in the accumulation of 226Ra by the plant species found. The highest activity of 226Ra was found in Potentilla reptans (4.09 Bq 226Ra/g of DW), Mentha arvensis (4.00 Bq 226Ra/g of DW), and Daucus carota (3.70 Bq 226Ra/g of DW). The greenhouse and small scale field experiments show Cannabis sativa "Beniko" as a good potential accumulator of activity 226Ra.},

	abstract = {A field-scale experiment to assess biostimulation of uranium reduction is underway at the Natural and Accelerated Bioremediation Research Field Research Center (FRC) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. To simulate the field experiment, we established replicate batch microcosms containing well-mixed contaminated sediment from a well within the FRC treatment zone, and we added an inoculum from a pilot-scale fluidized bed reactor representing the inoculum in the field experiment. After reduction of nitrate, both sulfate and soluble U(VI) concentration decreased. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy confirmed formation of U(IV) in sediment from biostimulated microcosms, but did not detect reduction of solid-phase Fe(III). Two to three fragments dominated terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiles of the 16S rDNA gene. Comparison to a clone library indicated these fragments represented denitrifying organisms related to Acidovorax, and Acidovorax isolates from the inoculum were subsequently shown to reduce U(VI). Investigation using the T-RFLP Analysis Program (TAP T-RFLP) and chemical analyses detected the presence and activity of fermenting and sulfate-reducing bacteria after 2 weeks. These organisms likely contributed to uranium reduction. In some microcosms, soluble U(VI) concentration leveled off or rebounded, indicating microbial and/or mineralogical heterogeneity among samples. Sulfate, acetate, and ethanol were depleted only in those microcosms exhibiting a rebound in soluble U(VI). This suggests that rates of U(VI) desorption can exceed rates of U(VI) reduction when sulfate-reducing bacteria become substrate-limited. These observations underscore the importance of effective chemical delivery and the role of serial and parallel processes in uranium reduction. © Springer 2006.},

Specific focus here is given to beryllium. Although nickel, uranium and arsenic were also analyzed, these results are not presented herein. Despite significant heterogeneity resulting from both natural and anthropogenic factors, sequential extraction results demonstrate that pH is a controlling factor in the prediction of the distribution of metal contaminants within the solid phases in soils at the site as well as the contaminant partitioning between the soil and the soil solution. Results for beryllium, in soils at the site as well as the contaminant partitioning between the soil and the soil solution. Results for beryllium, the most mobile metal evaluated, exhibit increasingattenuation along the plume flow path which corresponds to an increasing plume pH. These laboratory- and field-scale studies provide mechanistic information regarding partitioning of metals to soils at the site (one of the major attenuation mechanisms for the metals at the field site). Subsequently, these data have been used in the definition of the contaminant source terms and contaminant transport factors in risk modeling for the site. © 2006 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The mineralogy and geochemistry of soils developed over the unmined Coles Hill uranium deposit (Virginia) were studied to determine how phosphorous influences the speciation of uranium in oxidizing soil/saprolite systems typical of the eastern US. Results from this study have implications for both uranium remediation (e.g. in situ stabilization) and uranium resource exploration (e.g. near-surface geochemical sampling). The primary uranium ore (coffinite and uraninite hosted in quartzo-feldspathic gneiss) weathers to saprolites containing the same uranium concentration as the underlying ore (approximately 1000 mg U/kg saprolites). In these water saturated (below water table) saprolites the uranium is retained as uranyl phosphates of the meta-autunite group (mainly meta-uranocircite). Above the water table the soils overlying the deposit contain approximately 200 mg uranium per kg soil (20 times higher than uranium concentrations in similar soils formed from unmineralized rocks adjacent to the deposit). In these unsaturated zone soils uranium is retained by two processes: (1) incorporation into barium-strontium-calcium aluminum phosphate minerals of the crandallite group (mainly gorceixite), and (2) sorption of uranium with phosphorous onto iron oxides that coat the surfaces of other soil minerals. Thermodynamic calculations suggest that the meta-autunite group minerals present in the saprolites below the water table are not stable in the unsaturated zone soils overlying the deposit due to the drop in soil pH from ∼ 6.0 down to ∼ 4.5. Mineralogical observations suggest that, once exposed to the unsaturated environment, the meta-autunite group minerals react to form U(VI)-bearing aluminum phosphates and U(VI) surface complexes or nano-precipitates associated with ferric oxides. These results therefore indicate that models predicting U(VI) speciation in phosphate amended soils must simultaneously account for variations in pH, ion activities (aluminum appears to be particularly important) and surface complexation with iron oxide mineral surfaces. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Site characterization is an essential initial step in determining the feasibility of remedial alternatives at hazardous waste sites. Physicochemical and mineralogical characterization of U-contaminated soils in deeply weathered saprolite at Area 2 of the DOE Field Research Center (FRC) site, Oak Ridge, TN, was accomplished to examine the feasibility of bioremediation. Concentrations of U in soil-saprolite (up to 291 mg kg-1 in oxalate-extractable U o) were closely related to low pH (ca. 4-5), high effective cation exchange capacity without Ca (64.7-83.2 cmolc kg-1), amorphous Mn content (up to 9910 mg kg-1), and the decreased presence of relative clay mineral contents in the bulk samples (i.e., illite 2.5-12 wt. %, average 32 wt. %). The pH of the fill material ranged from 7.0 to 10.5, whereas the pH of the saprolite ranged from 4.5 to 8. Uranium concentration was highest (about 300 mg kg-1) at around 6 m below land surface near the saprolite-fill interface. The pH of ground water at Area 2 tended to be between 6 and 7 with U concentrations of about 0.9 to 1.7 mg L-1. These site specific characteristics of Area 2, which has lower U and nitrate contamination levels and more neutral ground water pH compared with FRC Areas 1 and 3 (ca. 5.5 and <4, respectively), indicate that with appropriate addition of electron donors and nutrients bioremediation of U by metal reducing microorganisms may be possible. © ASA, CSSA, SSSA.},

	abstract = {In order to elucidate the potential mechanisms of U(VI) reduction for the optimization of bioremediation strategies, the structure-function relationships of microbial communities were investigated in microcosms of subsurface materials cocontaminated with radionuclides and nitrate. A polyphasic approach was used to assess the functional diversity of microbial populations likely to catalyze electron flow under conditions proposed for in situ uranium bioremediation. The addition of ethanol and glucose as supplemental electron donors stimulated microbial nitrate and Fe(III) reduction as the predominant terminal electron-accepting processes (TEAPs). U(VI), Fe(III), and sulfate reduction overlapped in the glucose treatment, whereas U(VI) reduction was concurrent with sulfate reduction but preceded Fe(III) reduction in the ethanol treatments. Phyllosilicate clays were shown to be the major source of Fe(III) for microbial respiration by using variable-temperature Mössbauer spectroscopy. Nitrate- and Fe(III)-reducing bacteria (FeRB) were abundant throughout the shifts in TEAPs observed in biostimulated microcosms and were affiliated with the genera Geobacter, Tolumonas, Clostridium, Arthrobacter, Dechloromonas, and Pseudomonas. Up to two orders of magnitude higher counts of FeRB and enhanced U(VI) removal were observed in ethanol-amended treatments compared to the results in glucose-amended treatments. Quantification of citrate synthase (gltA) levels demonstrated a stimulation of Geobacteraceae activity during metal reduction in carbon-amended microcosms, with the highest expression observed in the glucose treatment. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the active FeRB share high sequence identity with Geobacteraceae members cultivated from contaminated subsurface environments. Our results show that the functional diversity of populations capable of U(VI) reduction is dependent upon the choice of electron donor. Copyright © 2008, American Society for Microbiology.

	abstract = {Nuclear weapons and fuel production have left many soils and sediments contaminated with toxic levels of uranium (U). Although previous short-term experiments on microbially mediated U(VI) reduction have supported the prospect of immobilizing the toxic metal through formation of insoluble U(IV) minerals, our longer-term (17 months) laboratory study showed that microbial reduction of U can be transient, even under sustained reducing conditions. Uranium was reduced during the first 80 days, but later (100-500 days) reoxidized and solubilized, even though a microbial community capable of reducing U(VI) was sustained. Microbial respiration caused increases in (bi)-carbonate concentrations and formation of very stable uranyl carbonate complexes, thereby increasing the thermodynamic favorability of U(IV) oxidation. We propose that kinetic limitations including restricted mass transfer allowed Fe-(III) and possibly Mn(IV) to persist as terminal electron acceptors (TEAs) for U reoxidation. These results show that in-situ U remediation by organic carbon-based reductive precipitation can be problematic in sediments and groundwaters with neutral to alkaline pH, where uranyl carbonates are most stable. © 2005 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {In this work, synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were carried out to elucidate at molecular scale the interaction mechanisms of Myxococcus xanthus with uranium at different pH values. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopic measurements showed that there are significant differences in the structural parameters of the U complexes formed by this bacterium at pH 2 and 4.5. At very low acidic pH of 2, the cells accumulated U(VI) as organic phosphate-metal complexes. At pH 4.5, however, the cells of this bacterium precipitated U(VI) as meta-autunite-like phase. TEM analyses demonstrated that at pH 2 the uranium accumulates were located mainly at the cell surface, whereas at pH 4.5 a uranium precipitation occurred on the cell wall and within the extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) characteristic of this bacterium. Dead/live staining studies showed that 30% and 50% of the uranium treated cell populations were alive at pH 2 and 4.5, respectively. The precipitation of U(VI) as mineral meta-autunite-like phase is possibly due to the bacterial acidic phosphatase activity. The precipitation of uranium as mineral phases may lead to more stable U(VI) sequestration that may be suitable for remediation purposes. These observations, combined with the very high uranium accumulation capability of the studied bacterial cells indicate that M. xanthus may significantly influence the fate of uranium in soil environments where these bacterial species are mainly found.},

	abstract = {A site in the former uranium mining area of Eastern Thuringia near Ronneburg was investigated with regard to effects of acid mine drainage (AMD) on reactive transport and bioattenuation. Processes involved in this attenuation might include physico-chemical reactions in reactive transport as well as activities of microorganisms for bioattenuation. In order to test the influence of the soil microbes, a mapping was carried out including both hydrogeochemical and microbiological parameters. Mapping of contamination was performed along the banks of a creek in a 900 m stretch in 50 m steps by hydrogeochemical analysis of water extracts of soil samples, while general microbial activity was scored by examining soil respiration. The soil samples with high heavy metal load did show low soil respiration as a parameter for microbial activity and plating revealed minimal counts for spore producing bacteria at these contaminated locations. Actinobacteria strains isolated from adjacent locations revealed high levels of resistance as well as high numbers of resistant strains. Specific responses in actinobacteria were investigated after isolation from each of the 18 measuring points along the creek. Specific adaptation strategies and high yields of (intra)cellular heavy metal retention could be seen. Several strategies for coping with the high heavy metal contents are further discussed and genes for proteins expressed specifically under high nickel concentration were identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. © 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

	abstract = {Groundwater within Area 3 of the U.S. Oepartment of Energy (OOE) Environmental Remediation Sciences Program (ERSP) Field Research Center at Oak Ridge, TN (ORFRC) contains up to 135 μM uranium as U(VI). Through a series of experiments at a pilot scale test facility, we explored the lower limits of groundwater U(VI) that can be achieved by in-situ biostimulation and the effects of dissolved oxygen on immobilized uranium. Weekly 2 day additions of ethanol over a 2-year period stimulated growth of denitrifying, Fe(III)-reducing, and sulfate-reducing bacteria, and immobilization of uranium as U(IV), with dissolved uranium concentrations decreasing to low levels. Following sulfite addition to remove dissolved oxygen, aqueous U(VI) concentrations fell below the U.S. Environmental Protection Agengy maximum contaminant limit (MCL) for drinking water (<30μg L-1 or 0.126 μM). Under anaerobic conditions, these low concentrations were stable, even in the absence of added ethanol. However, when sulfite additions stopped, and dissolved oxygen (4.0-5.5 mg L_1) entered the injection well, spatially variable changes in aqueous U(VI) occurred over a 60 day period, with concentrations increasing rapidly from <0.13 to 2.0 μM at a multilevel sampling (MLS) well located close to the injection well, but changing little at an MLS well located further away. Resumption of ethanol addition restored reduction of Fe(III), sulfate, and U(VI) within 36 h. After 2 years of ethanol addition. X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy (XANES) analyses indicated that U(IV) comprised 60-80% of the total uranium in sediment samples. At the completion of the project(day 1260), U concentrations in MLS wells were less than 0.1 μM. The microbial community at MLS wells with low U(VI) contained bacteria that are known to reduce uranium, including Desulfovibrio spp. and Geobacter spp., in both sediment and groundwater. The dominant Fe(III)-reducing species were Geothrix spp. © 2007 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Here we present results of a survey conducted to identify and characterize spontaneously growing arsenic-tolerant plant species of the area around the old arsenic/gold mine in ZlotyStok (Poland), with respect of their potential use in phytoremediation. Plants and soil from their rhizosphere were sampled and analyzed for concentrations of As and accompanying Mn, Fe, Mg, Ca, Al, Cu, Zn, Ba, Pb, Ni, Cs, V, Cr, Sr, Rb, Bi, Mo and U. The soil contained primarily very high As, Pb and Al concentrations (up to 7,451, 1,058 and 31,272 mg/kg respectively). The ability of identified species to modify the amount of bioavailable arsenic in their rhizosphere was determined by single extractions of soil samples with the use of water, phosphate buffer, EDTA, and acetic acid. Although As-hyperaccumulators were not found, Calamagrostis arundinaca was identified as a new species which successfully carried out the natural phytoextraction of arsenic. This plant was able to increase substantially the arsenic availability in the soil, and likely due to efficient uptake decreased the total As concentration within the root zone by around 40% relative to the reference soil. Thus, it has high potential for phytoremediation. The lowest amount of available arsenic was found in the rhizosphere of Stachys sylvatica, the species with the lowest As shoot concentration (compared with other plant species). It was proposed as a good candidate for phytostabilization. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The phosphatase phenotypes of strains belonging to the genera, Arthrobacter, Bacillus and Rahnella, previously isolated from subsurface soils at the US Department of Energy's (DOE) Oak Ridge Field Research Center (ORFRC), were determined. The ORFRC represents a unique, extreme environment consisting of highly acidic soils with co-occurring heavy metals, radionuclides and high nitrate concentrations. Isolates exhibiting phosphatase-positive phenotypes indicative of constitutive phosphatase activity were subsequently tested in U(VI) bioprecipitation assays. When aerobically grown in synthetic groundwater (pH 5.5) amended with 10 mM glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P), phosphatase-positive Bacillus and Rahnella spp. strains Y9-2 and Y9602 liberated sufficient phosphate to precipitate 73% and 95% of total soluble U added as 200 μM uranyl acetate respectively. In contrast, an Arthrobacter sp. X34 exhibiting a phosphatase-negative phenotype did not liberate phosphate from G3P or promote U(VI) precipitation.

	abstract = {Laboratory bench-scale soil washing (batch) and flushing (column flow) experiments were conducted to determine the efficiency of citric acid as an agent to extract uranium from a synthetically contaminated sandy soil. The results of soil washing and flushing experiments indicate that citric acid is highly effective in removing uranium, and that the extraction efficiency increases with increasing citric acid concentration, especially under slightly acidic to alkaline conditions in systems containing sand coated with secondary minerals (e.g., Fe). The enhanced U(VI) desorption in the presence of citrate may be explained through several processes, including the complexation of U(VI) with citrate and extraction of secondary coatings (e.g., Fe), which results in the liberation of Fe-citrate complexes into solution. In batch washing systems, the presence of 10-3 M citric acid enhances the extraction of uranium 2.8 times greater than water alone for the conditions of the experiment. A comparison of soil washing and flushing shows that the extraction efficiency is higher in bench-scale washing experiments. A removal efficiency of up to 98% was achieved with 10 mL of 10-3 M citric acid in batch systems, whereas it required 4 pore volumes (150 mL) of 0.1 M citric acid to accomplish similar extraction efficiencies in column soil flushing systems.

	abstract = {Uranium mobility in the environment is partially controlled by its oxidation state, where it exists as either U(VI) or U(IV). In aerobic environments, uranium is generally found in the hexavalent form, is quite soluble, and readily forms complexes with carbonate and calcium. Under anaerobic conditions, common metal respiring bacteria can reduce soluble U(VI) species to sparingly soluble UO2 (uraninite); stimulation of these bacteria, in fact, is being explored as an in situ uranium remediation technique. However, the stability of biologically precipitated uraninite within soils and sediments is not well characterized. Here we demonstrate that uraninite oxidation by Fe(III) (hydr)oxides is thermodynamically favorable under limited geochemical conditions. Our analysis reveals that goethite and hematite have a limited capacity to oxidize UO2(biogenic) while ferrihydrite can lead to UO2(biogenic) oxidation. The extent of UO2(biogenic) oxidation by ferrihydrite increases with increasing bicarbonate and calcium concentration, but decreases with elevated Fe(II)(aq) and U(VI) (aq) concentrations. Thus, our results demonstrate that the oxidation of UO2(biogenic) by Fe(III) (hydr)oxides may transpire under mildly reducing conditions when ferrihydrite is present. © 2006 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Goal, Scope and Background. During the Balkan conflict in 1999, soil in contaminated areas was enriched in depleted uranium (DU) isotopic signature, relative to the in-situ natural uranium present. After the military activities, most of kinetic DU penetrators or their fragments remained buried in the ground in certain geomorphological and geochemical environments exposed to local weathering conditions. The contamination distribution, mobility and/or fixation of DU in the contaminated soil profile at one hot spot were the subject of our study. The results should disclose what happened with released DU corrosion products in three years elapsed, given the scope of their geochemical fractionation, and mark out the most probable host substrates in investigated soil type. Methods. Gamma-spectrometric analysis of soil samples taken in the DU penetrator impact-zone was done to obtain present contamination levels. Set of samples is subjected to five-step and three-step sequential extraction procedures, specifically selective to different physical/chemical associations in soil. The stable elements are determined in extracts by the atomic absorption spectroscopy. After the ion-exchange based uranium separation procedure, alpha-spectrometric analysis of obtained fractions was done and DU distribution in five extraction phases found from 235U/238U and 234U/238U isotopic ratios. Results. Depleted uranium concentration falls down to the 1% of the initial value, at approximately 150 mm distance to the source. Carbonates and iron/manganese hydrous oxides are indicated as the most probable substrates for depleted uranium in the characterized soil type. Therefore, in the highly contaminated soil samples, depleted uranium is still weakly bonded and easy exchangeable. The significant levels of organic-bonded depleted uranium are found in surface soil only. Discussion. Dependence of the fractionation on the contamination levels is evident. Samples with higher DU contents have shown a longer maintenance in the exchangeable phases, probably because adsorption/desorption mass transfer through the medium was not very fast. Organic-bonded, depleted uranium is present in surface soil samples due to its higher humus content. Considering geochemical composition of investigated soil, the indicating chemical associations as substrates are in agreement with some considerations based on the results for low-level waste unsaturated zones. Conclusions. The soil contamination with depleted uranium in investigated area is still 'spot' type and not widespread. Dependence of the fractionation on the contamination levels and presence of weakly bonded, depleted uranium in the hot spots areas is evident. Recommendations and Perspectives. A detailed study may be undertaken with suitable extractive reagents to define a bio-available fraction of depleted uranium in soil. The comparison of results for different soil types investigated by the same methodology may be useful.

	abstract = {Aquifer sediments collected via split-spoon sampling in two new groundwater wells in the 200-UP-1 operable unit at the Hanford Site were characterized and showed typical Ringold Unit E Formation properties dominated by gravel and sand. High iron-oxide content in Fe oxide/clay coatings caused the highest U(VI) adsorption as quantified by batch Kd values, indicating iron oxides are the key solid adsorbent in the 200-UP-1 sediments that affect U(VI) fate and mobility. Even though U(VI) adsorption on the gravel-sized fraction of the sediments is considered to be negligible, careful characterization should be conducted to determine U(VI) adsorption on gravel, because of presence of Fe oxides coatings and diffusion-controlled adsorption into the gravel particles' interior surfaces. A linear adsorption isotherm was observed up to 10- 6 M (238 μg/L) of total U(VI) concentration in batch U(VI) adsorption tests with varying total U(VI) concentrations in spiked groundwater. U(VI) adsorption decreased with increasing concentrations of dissolved carbonate, because strong anionic aqueous uranium-carbonate complexes formed at high pH and high alkalinity conditions. Noticeable uranium desorption hysteresis was observed in a flow-through column experiment, suggesting that desorption Kd values for aged uranium-contaminated sediments at the Hanford Site can be larger than adsorption Kd values determined in short-term laboratory experiments and slow uranium release from contaminated sediments into the groundwater is expected.},

According to data from literature and results obtained in field studies, the general mineral class of apatites was selected as a most promising amendment for in situ immobilization/remediation of U. In this work we presented theoretical assessment of stability of U(VI) in four apatite systems (hydroxyapatite (HAP), North Carolina Apatite (NCA), Lisina Apatite (LA), and Apatite II) in order to determine an optimal apatite soil amendment which could be used for in situ remediation of uranium. In this analysis we used a theoretical criterion which is based on calculation of the ion-ion interaction potential, representing the main term of the cohesive energy of the matrix/pollutant system. The presented results of this analysis indicate (i) that the mechanism of immobilization of U by natural apatites depends on their chemical composition and (ii) that all analyzed apatites represent, from the point of view of stability, promising materials which could be used in field remediation of U-contaminated sites. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The bioreduction of soluble uranium [U(VI)] to sparingly soluble U(IV) species is an attractive remedial technology for contaminated soil and groundwater due to the potential for immobilizing uranium and impeding its migration in subsurface environments. This manuscript describes a column study designed to simulate a three-step strategy proposed for the remediation of a heavily contaminated site at the U.S. Department of Energy's NABIR Field Research Center in Oak Ridge, TN. The soil is contaminated with high concentrations of uranium, aluminum, and nitrate and has a low, highly buffered pH (∼3.5). Steps proposed for remediation are (i) flushing to remove nitrate and aluminum, (ii) neutralization to establish pH conditions favorable for biostimulation, and (iii) biostimulation for U(VI) reduction. We simulated this sequence using a packed soil column containing undisturbed aggregates of U(VI)-contaminated saprolite that was flushed with an acidified salt solution (pH 4.0), neutralized with bicarbonate (60 mM), and then biostimulated by adding ethanol. The column was operated anaerobically in a closed-loop recirculation setup. However, during the initial month of biostimulation, ethanol was not utilized, and U(VI) was not reduced. A bacterial culture enriched from the site groundwater was subsequently added, and the consumption of ethanol coupled with sulfate reduction immediately ensued. The aqueous concentration of U(VI) initially increased, evidently because of the biological production of carbonate, a ligand known to solubilize uranyl. After ∼50 days, aqueous U(VI) concentrations rapidly decreased from ∼17 to <1 mg/L Atthe conclusion of the experiment, the presence of reduced solid phase U(IV) was confirmed using X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy. The results indicate that bioreduction to immobilize uranium is potentially feasible at this site; however, the stability of the reduced U(IV) and its potential reoxidation will require further investigation. © 2005 American Chemical Society.},

In this study, we characterized metabolically active and total microbial communities associated with uranium-contaminated subsurface sediments along geochemical gradients. DNA and RNA were extracted and amplified from four sediment-depth intervals representing moderately acidic (pH 3.7) to near-neutral (pH 6.7) conditions. Phylotypes related to Proteobacteria (Alpha-, Beta-, Delta- and Gammaproteobacteria), Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Planctomycetes were detected in DNA- and RNA-derived clone libraries. Diversity and numerical dominance of phylotypes were observed to correspond to changes in sediment geochemistry and rates of microbial activity, suggesting that geochemical conditions have selected for well-adapted taxa. Sequences closely related to nitrate-reducing bacteria represented 28% and 43% of clones from the total and metabolically active fractions of the microbial community, respectively. This study provides the first detailed analysis of total and metabolically active microbial communities in radionuclide-contaminated subsurface sediments. Our microbial community analysis, in conjunction with rates of microbial activity, points to several groups of nitrate-reducers that appear to be well adapted to environmental conditions common to radionuclide-contaminated sites. © 2006 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.},

	abstract = {To evaluate the potential for in situ bioremediation of U(VI) to sparingly soluble U(IV), we constructed a pilot test facility at Area 3 of the U.S. Department of Energy Natural and Accelerated Bioremediation Research (NABIR) Field Research Center (FRC) in Oak Ridge, TN. The facility is adjacent to the former S-3 Ponds which received trillions of liters of acidic plating wastes. High levels of uranium are present, with up to 800 mg kg-1 in the soil and 84-210 μM in the groundwater. Ambient groundwater has a highly buffered pH of ∼3.4 and high levels of aluminum (12-13 mM), calcium (22-25 mM), and nitrate (80-160 mM). Adjusting the pH of groundwater to ∼5 within the aquifer would deposit extensive aluminum hydroxide precipitate. Calcium is present in the groundwater at levels that inhibit U(VI) reduction, but its removal by injection of a high pH solution would generate clogging precipitate. Nitrate also inhibits U(VI) reduction and is present at such high concentrations that its removal by in situ denitrification would generate large amounts of N2 gas and biomass. To establish and maintain hydraulic control, we installed a four well recirculation system parallel to geologic strike, with an inner loop nested within an outer loop. For monitoring, we drilled three boreholes perpendicular to strike across the inner loop and installed multilevel sampling tubes within them. A tracer pulse with clean water established travel times and connectivity between wells and enabled the assessment of contaminant release from the soil matrix. Subsequently, a highly conductive region of the subsurface was prepared for biostimulation by removing clogging agents and inhibitors and increasing pH. For 2 months, groundwater was pumped from the hydraulically conductive zone; treated to remove aluminum, calcium, and nitrate, and supplemented with tap water; adjusted to pH 4.3-4.5; then returned to the hydraulically conductive zone. This protocol removed most of the aqueous aluminum and calcium. The pH of the injected treated water was then increased to 6.0-6.3. With additional flushing, the pH of the extracted water gradually increased to 5.5-6.0, and nitrate concentrations fell to 0.5-1.0 mM. These conditions were judged suitable for biostimulation. In a companion paper (Wu et al., Environ. Sci. Technol. 2006, 40, 3978-3987), we describe the effects of ethanol addition on in situ denitrification and U(VI) reduction and immobilization. © 2006 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The stimulation of microbial U(VI) reduction is currently being investigated as a means to reduce uranium's mobility in groundwater, but little is known about the concentration at which U(VI) might inhibit microbial activity, or the effect of U(VI) on bacterial community structure. We investigated these questions with an ethanol-fed U(VI)-and sulfate-reducing enrichment developed from sediment from the site of an ongoing field biostimulation experiment at Area 3 of the Oak Ridge Field Research Center (FRC). Sets of triplicate enrichments were spiked with increasing concentrations of U(VI) (from 49 μm to 9.2 mM). As the U(VI) concentration increased to 224 μM, the culture's production of acetate from ethanol slowed, and at or above 1.6 mM U(VI) little acetate was produced over the time frame of the experiment. An uncoupling inhibition model was applied to the data, and the inhibition coefficient for U(VI), KU, was found to be -100 μM U(VI), or 24 mg/L, indicating the inhibitory effect is relevant at highly contaminated sites. Microbial community structure at the conclusion of the experiment was analyzed with terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis. T-RFs associated with Desulfovibrio-like organisms decreased in relative abundance with increasing U(VI) concentration, whereas Clostridia-like T-RFs increased. © 2007 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The radon diffusion coefficient for soil, D, is a very important parameter used to estimate radon dose for uranium-bearing waste. Many Ds were measured in the uranium mill tailing remediation action project in the US, and a formula for the estimation of diffusion coefficient, Rogers's formula, was proposed. However, it is uncertain whether Rogers's formula is applicable to Japanese soils because most of them have come from volcanic ash and contain much water. This paper describes the development of a measurement apparatus for D using a lump response transient method and a step response transient method, and presents measured D values for Japanese surface soils. Measured alpha ray count curves are good in agreement with those of theory. This shows that radon transportation in soil can be described using Fick's law. Furthermore, the measured effective D values are good in agreement with those of Rogers's formula. This means that Rogers's formula can be applied to Japanese soils. © Atomic Energy Society of Japan.},

[1] In the 1990's, a modern version of the Lapointe Picker for soil sorting was developed around the need to clean the Johnston Atoll of plutonium. It worked well with sand, but these systems are ineffective with soil, especially with wet conditions. Additionally, several other constraints limited throughput. Slow moving belts and thin layers of material on the belt coupled with the use of multiple small detectors and small sorting gates make these systems ineffective for high throughput. Soil sorting of clay-bearing soils and building debris requires a new look at both the material handling equipment, and the radiation detection methodology. A new class of Super-Sorters has attained throughput of one hundred times that of the old designs. Higher throughput means shorter schedules which reduce costs substantially. The planning, cost, implementation, and other site considerations for these new Super-Sorters are discussed.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine how structure, stratigraphy, and weathering influence fate and transport of contaminants (particularly U) in the ground water and geologic material at the Department of Energy (DOE) Environmental Remediation Sciences Department (ERSD) Field Research Center (FRC). Several cores were collected near four former unlined adjoining waste disposal ponds. The cores were collected, described, analyzed for U, and compared with ground water geochemistry from surrounding multilevel wells. At some locations, acidic U-contaminated ground water was found to preferentially flow in small remnant fractures weathering the surrounding shale (nitric acid extractable U [UNA] usually < 50 mg kg-1) into thin (<25 cm) Fe oxide-rich clayey seams that retain U (UNA 239 to 375 mg kg-1). However, greatest contaminant transport occurs in a 2 to 3 m thick more permeable stratigraphic transition zone located between two less permeable, and generally less contaminated zones consisting of (i) overlying unconsolidated saprolite (UNA < 0.01 to 200 mg kg-1) and (ii) underlying less-weathered bedrock (UNA generally < 0.01 to 7 mg kg-1). In this transition zone, acidic (pH < 4) U-enriched ground water (U of 38 mg L-1) has weathered away calcite veins resulting in greater porosity, higher hydraulic conductivity, and higher U contamination (UNA 106 to 745 mg kg-1) of the weathered interbedded shale and sandstone. These characteristics of the transition zone produce an interval with a high flux of contaminants that could be targeted for remediation. © ASA, CSSA, SSSA.},

	abstract = {Inadequate remediation of uranium mining in the Karoo Uranium Province, South Africa led to a disused open pit and inclined shaft, uranium ore in stockpiles and barrels, as well as other mining related equipment. Land owners were unaware of the potential threat of uranium and coherent heavy metals resulting in livestock grazing amongst ore stockpiles and drinking from contaminated water supplies. Land owners consequently used stockpiled uranium ore for gravel road maintenance and construction of farmhouse foundations. The concentration of the radioactive gas radon (222Rn) was monitored in the aforementioned farmhouse and reached 835 Bq.m-3, thus exceeding the concentration limitations (150 Bq.m-3) for radon gas in dwellings set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Lycium cinereum, Fingerhuthia africana, Aristida congesta congesta and Phragmites australis growing within these mining locations revealed high concentrations of uranium and molybdenum in leaves and roots. Lycium cinereum were found to accumulate molybdenum up to 650 ppm in some leaves. Uranium readily accumulates in the roots of some of the species, whilst only a fraction is translocated to the leaves. Plants were also subjected to protein profile studies revealing a general tendency that with an increase in uranium and molybdenum concentrations, protein concentrations in the leaves tend to decrease. These fauna serve not only as a toxicological hazard for grazing livestock, but also as potential phytoremediators of polluted soils. Xenopus laevis were found to reside within a water filled open pit where uranium and molybdenum concentrations reach 20 mg/l and 4 mg/l respectively. These aquatic organisms contain high hepatic, renal and bone concentrations of uranium and molybdenum. Histological sections of liver and kidney revealed anomalous levels of lymphocytes, indicative of infection or neoplasia, possibly as a result of heavy metal uptake.},

In this paper medic and ryegrass plants were used as host plants to examine whether inoculation with an AM fungus, Glomus intraradices, would help phytostabilization of U tailings. The need of amending with uncontaminated soil for supporting plant survival was also examined by mixing soil with U tailing at different mixing ratios. Soil amendment increased plant growth and P uptake. Ryegrass produced a more extensive root system and a greater biomass than medic plants at all mixing ratios. Medic roots were extensively colonized by G. intraradices whereas ryegrass were more sparsely colonized. Plant growth was not improved by mycorrhizas, which, however, improved P nutrition of medic plants. Medic plants contained higher U concentrations and showed higher specific U uptake efficiency compared to ryegrass. In the presence of U tailing, most U had been retained in plant roots, and this distribution pattern was further enhanced by mycorrhizal colonization. The results suggest a role for AM fungi in phytostabilization of U tailings. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Realisation of the experiment is planned for years 2007 and 2008. The principle of immobilization of contaminants in-situ is to develop special conditions in water bearing sandstone sediments when transformation of contaminants from mobile form to immobile form can happen. Under the conditions of remediation after chemical mining (using sulphuric acid) of uranium on the deposit Straz it means injecting suitable alkaline medium and its spreading in contaminated sandstone aquifer. It will lead to decreasing of acidity of contaminated groundwater and precipitating of contaminants (SO4 2, Al, Fe) in pores. This process is followed by co-precipitation and sorption of other toxic contaminants as As and Be. The results of the pilot experiment will be used for design of application of method of immobilization in-situ in the frame of remediation after chemical mining of uranium on the deposit Straz with the aim to decrease time and costs of the whole remediation process.

	abstract = {The Linde FUSRAP Site is an environmental project location where remedial action addresses uranium ore refinement residues (uranium-238, thorium-230, and radium-226) from Manhattan Engineer District (MED) activities. The project is located at Praxair Inc., a research & development facility employing 1,400 people and a command / control center for a world-wide network of production plants. Cleanup of radioactive materials commingled in soil, debris, and remaining structures uses Multi-Agency Radiation Site Survey and Investigation Manual (MARSSIM) - based methodology and procedures for verification. Site reutilization follows completion of a Final Status Survey. Building 14, a radiologically impacted MED era structure, required dismantlement in 2004 at the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) Linde Site Remediation project in Tonawanda, New York. The challenge for the project and facility team was to accomplish replacement of the utility tunnel, including relocated infrastructure installation, in less than 16 months to enable Building 14 dismantlement to start on time without causing adverse impact to Praxair's operations. Due to spacial limitations, a substantial portion of the new tunnel's footprint was in areas contaminated with low-level radiological material produced by MED activities, and remedial action had to precede the new tunnel installation. Praxair's operations depended upon uninterrupted function of multiple utility systems contained within a service tunnel running under Building 14.Design was initiated in the March of 2003. Construction started in September 2003 and proceeded through the winter for successful completion in May 2004.},

	abstract = {A microcosm study was performed to investigate the effect of ethanol and acetate on uranium(VI) biological reduction and microbial community changes under various geochemical conditions. Each microcosm contained an uranium-contaminated sediment (up to 2.8 g U/kg) suspended in buffer with bicarbonate at concentrations of either 1 or 40 mM and sulfate at either 1.1 or 3.2 mM. Ethanol or acetate was used as an electron donor. Results indicate that ethanol yielded in significantly higher U(VI) reduction rates than acetate. A low bicarbonate concentration (1 mM) was favored for U(VI) bioreduction to occur in sediments, but high concentrations of bicarbonate (40 mM) and sulfate (3.2 mM) decreased the reduction rates of U(VI). Microbial communities were dominated by species from the Geothrix genus and Proteobacteria phylum in all microcosms. However, species in the Geobacteraceae family capable of reducing U(VI) were significantly enriched by ethanol and acetate in low-bicarbonate buffer. Ethanol increased the population of unclassified Desulfuromonales, while acetate increased the population of Desulfovibrio. Additionally, species in the Geobacteraceae family were not enriched in high-bicarbonate buffer, but the Geothrix and the unclassified Betaproteobacteria species were enriched. This study concludes that ethanol could be a better electron donor than acetate for reducing U(VI) under given experimental conditions, and electron donor and groundwater geochemistry alter microbial communities responsible for U(VI) reduction. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Microorganisms are very important for the bioremediation of the environment because they are able to adsorb radionuclides and other heavy metals. They significantly influence mobilization and immobilization of metal ions in soils. We investigated representative the complexation of the uranyl ion with main parts of bacterial cell walls. Lipopolysaccharide LPS is the principal component of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria, whereas peptidoglycan (PGN) represents the basis of the cell wall of gram-positve bacteria. Both biomolecules contain a high density of metal-binding functionalities like carboxyl, amino, and hydroxyl groups. LPS offers additionally a high amount on phosphoryl groups, which are missing in PGN. We investigated the interaction of the uranyl cation (UO22+) with the biopolymers LPS and PGN by using potentiometric titration and time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS) over a wide pH range (2.4 - 9) and at environmentally relevant low uranium concentrations (10 -4 - 10-5 M). Using potentiometric titration, the dissociation constants of the respective functional groups were determined. Furthermore essential uranyl complexes and their stability constants were identified. With the aid of time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS) the luminescence properties of uranyl complexes with the biopolymers and the associated stability constants were investigated. At low pH values both biomolecules effect an increase of the luminescence intensity and a red-shift of about 8-10 nm, compared to the free UO22+ ion. With LPS the luminescence intensity increases up to pH 8. In contrast to LPS, the PGN polymer causes a decrease of the luminescence intensity over pH 4.5, indicating, that a non-luminescent complex has built.},

The distribution coefficient (Kd) for U(VI) in a leachate that is predicted to result from the weathering of vitrified wastes disposed in the IDF is 0 mL/g due to the high sodium and carbonate concentrations and high pH of the glass leachate. However, when the pH and alkalinity of the IDF sediment native pore water increases during mixing with the glass leachate, U(VI) uptake is observed and the value of the U(VI) Kd increases 4.3 mL/g, because of U(VI) coprecipitation with newly formed calcite. A nonelectrostatic, generalized composite approach for surface complexation modeling was applied and a combination of two U(VI) surface species, monodentate (SOUO2+), and bidentate (SO2UO 2(CO3)2-), simulated the measured U(VI) sorption data very well. The generalized composite surface complexation model, when compared to the constant or single-valued Kd model, more accurately predicted U(VI) sorption under the varying geochemical conditions expected at the IDF. © 2007 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {During the operational life of a plant for processing uranium and manufacturing fuel elements, large amounts of radioactive materials (mostly liquid) are released through leaks within the sewer system and process water pipes. This paper addresses from a radiological viewpoint the remediation of soil contamination (unsaturated zone) and contamination within the saturated zone (water / soil) of the ground. In the course of soil remediation, in situ gamma spectrometry was used to localize contamination, to evaluate it 100% radiologically and to add it to the according disposal of nuclear residual material. Vertically implanted centers of contamination within the saturated zone were localized via the soil-water path by means of the radiological evaluation process during the soil remediation. From the center of contamination in the ground water flow direction, widespread contamination with uranium took place in the saturated zone as a result of the interactions between soil and water. The transport of the contamination is depending on the specific aquifer parameters on the site. Low-volume reconnaissance drillings were carried out in galleries arranged vertically to the direction of the ground water flow in order to identify the main contamination center vertically and horizontally as well as the migration of the contamination within the aquifer system. Radiological evaluation of the drill samples together with the results of a geophysical investigation of the aquifer structure and the knowledge of the hydrological conditions on the site enabled the remediation strategy to focus on the mass-related activity of uranium in the soil of clean-up area. The resulting remediation target within the saturated zone and therefore the resulting scope of the clean-up was adjusted to fit the clean-up success rate in proportion to the clean-up effort required ("optimization").The radiological protection aim for protecting the population and the environment was maintained during and after the clean-up through a verified barrier effect of a ground water clean-up plant, and evidenced by means of a thorough downstream ground water monitoring program. Cleaning up the saturated zone was achieved by replacing the soil by means of large-scale drillings to a depth of 10m in the direction of the ground water flow. The clean-up was divided into an investigation phase in order to verify the remediation target which has been defined, and a remediation phase in which the volumes resulted were replaced. 100 percent of the soil in the main contamination centre was replaced by overlapping drillings and accompanying backfills with uncontaminated material. It was possible to provide proof that the remediation target had been reached during the clean-up process. Residual activity remaining downstream from the contamination center in the saturated zone is removed by means of a ground water clean-up plant with a "pump & treat" method. The limit values for the ground water have not yet been reached. However, the barrier function of the ground water clean-up system ensures that the radiological protection aim is met, and is monitored at the wells of the ground water monitoring program. This allows a potential conventional usage of the plant site during the post-clean-up phase. Copyright © 2005 by ASME.},

In several places, mining waste and low-grade uranium ore left on the surface contain radioactivity above regional background. Most of the former mining sites present no enhanced radionuclide concentrations. However, in the mining facilities where the radioactive ore was chemically extracted, mill tailings contain materials with elevated levels of radioactivity, up to 200 times the levels in unaffected soils of the region. Mud from neutralization ponds used to treat acid mine waters contains also elevated radionuclide concentrations. Furthermore, depending on the type of waste, the radioelement composition varies.

	abstract = {The testing of depleted uranium (DU; a 97.25% U:0.75% Ti alloy) ammunition and its use in recent war campaigns in Iraq (1991 and 2003) and the Balkans (1995 and 1999) has led to dispersion of thermodynamically unstable DU metal into the environment [1-3]. Although less radioactive, DU has the same chemotoxicity as natural uranium and poses a threat to human populations [1]. Uranium tends to form stable aqueous complexes and precipitates with organic ligands [4], suggesting that living organisms could play an important role in geochemical transformations and cycling. Fungi are one of the most biogeochemically active components of the soil microbiota [5], particularly in the aerobic plant-root zone. Although the mutualistic symbiotic associations (mycorrhizas) of fungi with plants are particularly important in mineral transformations [5], fungal effects on metallic DU have not been studied. Here, we report that free-living and plant symbiotic (mycorrhizal) fungi can colonize DU surfaces and transform metallic DU into uranyl phosphate minerals. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A 1.6 ha plot of Atriplex canescens (fourwing saltbush) was established in a desert soil at a former uranium ore-processing plant, near Monument Valley, Arizona, to remediate nitrate and ammonium N contamination. The plants were irrigated to stimulate growth and N uptake. However, NO 3 - loss from the soil was unexpectedly rapid. Initially, the soil contained approximately 180 mg kg -1 NO 3 --N distributed at depths up to 4.6 m, but concentrations decreased to 80 mg kg -1 after 41 months. Losses occurred throughout the plot at all soil depths. NH 4-N remained unchanged (ca.180 mg kg -1). Soil moisture was generally below field capacity and soil-water flux showed no net downward movement over the course of the study. A salt balance showed a 10% decrease in soluble salts during the study, attributable to the loss in NO 3 -. Residual soluble soil N became progressively enriched in 15N over time, consistent with biological denitrification. Additionally, microcosm studies indicate significant potential denitrification rates on the plot but not for control soils. Total losses of NO 3 --N were 1360 kg ha -1 yr -1. These findings of rapid denitrification in the vadose zone of a desert soil are unique and may offer a low-cost method for NO 3 - remediation at similar sites. These findings are also of interest due to the depth at which the losses occurred and the possibility that considerable amounts of naturally occurring NO 3 - in deep vadose zone desert soils in the southwestern US could be similarly mobilized by changing land use practices or climate change. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Contamination by uranium (U) occurs principally at U mining and processing sites. Uranium can have tremendous environmental consequences, as it is highly toxic to a broad range of organisms and can be dispersed in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Remediation strategies of U-contaminated soils have included physical and chemical procedures, which may be beneficial, but are costly and can lead to further environmental damage. Phytoremediation has been proposed as a promising alternative, which relies on the capacity of plants and their associated microorganisms to stabilize or extract contaminants from soils. In this paper, we review the role of a group of plant symbiotic fungi, i.e. arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, which constitute an essential link between the soil and the roots. These fungi participate in U immobilization in soils and within plant roots and they can reduce root-to-shoot translocation of U. However, there is a need to evaluate these observations in terms of their importance for phytostabilization strategies. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Natural attenuation processes resulting from the afforestation of some U-waste rock piles have the potential to limit the linkage of radioelements and other trace pollutants, thereby minimizing exposure risks. We determined the evolution of pH and organic matter and compared the 226Ra and Ca extractability in pyrite-containing mining debris which was revegetated 35 years ago with Scots pine. Oxidation of sulphidic minerals remaining in the substrate appeared to dominate over acidification processes due to vegetation inputs and litter decomposition. The accumulation of organic matter in forest floor had a negligible effect on the 226Ra upward recycling compared to the migration losses observed mainly from decarbonatation of the surface mining debris. 226Ra was overall less soluble than Ca in the soil profile but NH4Ac-pH 5 had the capacity to extract a 226Ra fraction of 31.1-41.5%, i.e. at least twice as much as for Ca. In deeper layers, a majority of both Ca and 226Ra were extractable from the same non-specific adsorption pool, which mainly involved carbonate. In the upper acidified layer, the incorporation of organic matter had no effect on 226Ra extractability. A further specific adsorption pool for 226Ra was attributed to the formation of sparingly soluble Fe-Al oxyhydroxides. However, that specific 226Ra-bearing phase was readily dissolved in NH4Ac-pH 5, indicating a relatively reversibility of the precipitation reaction of 226Ra with amorphous oxide. Trees are effective at reducing hydrological release of many pollutants but in the mining debris studied, four decades of pine growth did not significantly promote 226Ra remediation in the soil. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Soil respiration data showed increasing variation indicating stress response and hence need for adaptation. Thus, isolation of single strains was performed for more detailed analyses. Of the isolated fungi and bacteria (single-celled bacteria as well as filamentous actinobacteria), 15 were grown in mine drainage waters in order to test their capacity to retain (heavy) metals including rare earth elements and radioisotopes. Out of the 15 strains (respectively 5 single-celled bacteria, actinobacteria and fungi), 11 strains could grow in media containing acid mine drainage waters diluted by half which is representative of the conditions a few meters downstream of the entry point of the acid mine drainage. Two strains showed promising capacity for aluminum or uranium retention. Using rare earth elements as tracers, selective biosorption or uptake of heavy rare earth elements was prominent in one sample, a fungal isolate. The actinobacterial strains also showed capacity for bioremediation of contaminated seepage waters. Different reactions to single elements varying between all isolates indicate biologically controlled transport processes because such strong fractionation would not be expected from physico-chemical adsorption processes. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The understanding of molecular mechanisms in the cycling of elements in general is essential to our alteration of current processes. One field where such geochemical element cycles are of major importance is the prevention and treatment of acid mine drainage waters (AMD) which are prone to occur in every anthropogenic, modified landscape where sulfidic rock material has been brought to the surface during mine operations. Microbiologically controlled production of AMD leads not only to acidification, but at the same time the dissolution of heavy metals makes them bioavailable posing a potential ecotoxicological risk. The water path then can contaminate surface and ground water resources which leads to even bigger problems in large catchment areas. The investigation of mechanisms in natural attenuation has already provided first ideas for applications of naturally occurring bioremediation schemes. Especially an improved soil microflora can enhance the natural attenuation when adapted microbes are applied to contaminated areas. Future schemes for plant extraction, control of water efflux by increasing evapotranspiration, and by subsequent land use with agricultural plants with biostabilization and phytosequestration potential will provide putative control measures. The mechanisms in parts of these processes have been evaluated and the resulting synthesis applied to derive a bioremediation plan using the former uranium mine in Eastern Thuringia as a case study. © 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

	abstract = {The fate and transport of uranium in contaminated soils and sediments may be affected by adsorption onto the surface of minerals such as montmorillonite. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy has been used to investigate the adsorption of uranyl (UO22+) onto Wyoming montmorillonite. At low pH (∼4) and low ionic strength (10-3 M), uranyl has an EXAFS spectrum indistinguishable from the aqueous uranyl cation, indicating binding via cation exchange. At near-neutral pH (∼7) and high ionic strength (1 M), the equatorial oxygen shell of uranyl is split, indicating inner-sphere binding to edge sites. Linear-combination fitting of the spectra of samples reacted under conditions where both types of binding are possible reveals that cation exchange at low ionic strengths on SWy-2 may be more important than predicted by past surface complexation models of U(VI) adsorption on related montmorillonites. Analysis of the binding site on the edges of montmorillonite suggests that U(VI) sorbs preferentially to [Fe(O,OH)6] octahedral sites over [Al(O,OH)6] sites. When bound to edge sites, U(VI) occurs as uranyl-carbonato ternary surface complexes in systems equilibrated with atmospheric CO2. Polymeric surface complexes were not observed under any of the conditions studied. Current surface complexation models of uranyl sorption on clay minerals may need to be reevaluated to account for the possible increased importance of cation exchange reactions at low ionic strengths, the presence of reactive octahedral iron surface sites, and the formation of uranyl-carbonato ternary surface complexes. Considering the adsorption mechanisms observed in this study, future studies of U(VI) transport in the environment should consider how uranium retardation will be affected by changes in key solution parameters, such as pH, ionic strength, exchangeable cation composition, and the presence or absence of CO2.

Two plant species, Lupinus angustifolius L. and Secale cereale L. were grown at the site in a controlled experiment. We estimated the differences in soil pH, soil humidity, metal content, S-SO4, P-PO4, nitrogen (ammonium, nitrate and nitrite), plant growth, and plant uptake of metals between the experimental variants. The study indicated that the most efficient treatment (in terms of biomass increase) was compost, followed by topsoil and urea addition. The mechanism underlying this effect was the change in soil parameters leading to higher availability of nutrients. There was, however, a depletion of the soil nitrogen in the amended variants at the end of the growing season. © 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Surveys of arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF) root colonization and spore status of slimes dams of South Africa's deep level gold mines in the North-West province were undertaken in the late summer of 1999. Five indicator host plant species [Asclepias fruticosa L., Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers., Atriplex semibaccata R. Br., Phytolacca octandra L. and Asparagus laricinus Burch.] were sampled from the surrounding natural soils (veld) and dams of three age categories (recently-revegetated-RV, old-revegetated-OV and never-revegetated-NV) within the different zones of each dam (top, lower slopes, retaining wall, toepaddocks). Host species and broad substratum type (slimes, slimes-polluted veld and veld) showed significant effects on AM root parameters. Overall, A. fruticosa and A. laricinus were the most mycotrophic hosts on RV, OV and NV slimes and C. dactylon and A. semibaccata in the veld. On RV sites there were negligible differences between host species and zones in mycorrhizal parameters, whereas on OV and NV sites most parameters were significantly different, with significant interactive effects between host species and zones. No differences in spore densities between host species or age categories were found but total spore densities between zones were significantly different. NV slopes had the lowest pH, aerial cover, organic matter and total P but highest potential acidity and weak relationships were found between zone pH and mycorrhizal colonization parameters. These results are discussed in relation to the factors affecting distribution of AMF on these sites and the options relating to AMF inoculum introduction in rehabilitation programmes. © 2006 SAAB.},

	abstract = {From the early 1940s to the early 1950s, various forms of uranium were processed at a site in the Midwestern United States. Based on gamma walkover survey results, uranium is concentrated near the primary process building, and excavation is necessary. However, contamination is much more sparsely distributed over large, more remote areas of the site. A cleanup criterion was established for determining whether the remote areas are likely to pass closure protocol established using the Multi-Agency Radiation Survey and Site Investigation Manual (MARSSIM). Two key issues were considered as part of the characterization strategy. Because it is expensive to dispose of radiologically contaminated soil, the degree of uncertainty about the projected volume of contaminated soil is a critical factor in estimating the cost and schedule of the remediation. The second issue is determining whether the large, remote areas are likely to meet closure criteria or require remediation. Three statistical techniques were considered as tools to be used to guide characterization activities and to quantify the important elements of decision uncertainty. Their utility and applicability depended upon the spatial characteristics of the contamination and the decisions to be made. Variograms, geostatistical tools that determine the increasing variance with increasing data separation distance, were used. The parametric geostatistical approach resulted in poorly supported variograms that did not show a clear spatial correlation near the processing building, indicating that kriging of concentration values was inappropriate for resolving excavation boundaries. Indicator geostatistics were then considered. Applying a binary perspective to the data (i.e., a point is either above or below the cleanup criterion) provided an indicator variogram that was far more robust than that obtained with the parametric data. The spatial correlation observed using the indicator approach provides a more technically defensible delineation of excavation footprints, and kriging of indicator values provides a means of quantifying and evaluating uncertainty by measuring the relationship between contaminated area (or volume) and contamination probability. For the larger, remote areas where uranium concentrations are low and there is no spatial correlation between sampling points, the approach is to use MARSSIM, which is based on a classical statistical approach already well-accepted in the regulatory community. The goal is to evaluate each survey unit's potential of meeting the closure criteria without remediation. If a unit fails to meet the criteria, the offending portion is isolated and subject to a denser sampling scheme or designated for remediation. This case study demonstrates how a variety of statistical tools were applied to two distinct regions of a site. Our experiences have shown that parametric geostatistics generally fail in determining spatial correlation in anthropogenic contamination; indicator geostatistics provide a technically defensible estimate of areas or volumes that are above or below a specified cleanup criterion, for instance in determining the footprint of soil to be excavated; and classical statistics are appropriate for closeout of broad areas with low levels of contamination.

	abstract = {Mining activities are a major source of land degradation in arid regions, and remediation methods developed for mesic sites may not be appropriate for arid sites. In climates where potential evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation, it might be possible to prevent the migration of contaminants away from a mine site by controlling the site water balance through vegetation, and allowing natural attenuation processes to reduce pollutant levels over time. We investigated the feasibility of remediating a nitrate-contaminated source-plume system in a desert environment using biological methods. The study site was a former uranium mill in Monument Valley, Arizona, where NO3- used in ore processing had leaked from the soil beneath a tailings pile (referred to as the source area) into an alluvial aquifer (referred to as the plume) spreading away from the source area. We used 15N/14N ratios and direct assays of denitrification to show that biological denitrification occurred in both the source area and plume, and could reduce NO3- levels over time. Denitrification in the source area could be stimulated by providing additional moisture to the soil through irrigation, whereas providing a carbon source (ethanol) stimulated denitrification in samples from the plume. We used 18O/16O and H/deuterium signatures in water and plant samples to show that the native saltbush (Atriplex canescens) and black greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus) plant community was extracting water from the plume, offering a possible means of preventing migration of the plume by controlling grazing over the site. We conclude that biological remediation is a feasible alternative to pump/treat solutions at this type of site. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PORTS), owned and operated by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), has produced enriched uranium since the early 1950s. The X120 Goodyear Training Facility has been operated since plant construction as a machine shop, paint shop, and warehouse space. It is highly probable that the machine and metal shops used solvents and degreasers while in operation. The past disposal procedures for these substances are unknown. The X-120 facilities were demolished and removed in the late-1970s, prior to the more recent construction of the Gas Centrifuge Enrichment Plant. Several remedial investigations, however, have identified various VOCs (volatile organic compounds), primarily TCE (trichloroethylene), at detectable levels in the groundwater. Phytoremediation technology is based on the ability of certain plant species and their associated rhizospheric microorganisms to remove, degrade, or contain chemical contaminants located in the soil, sediment, surface water, groundwater, and possibly even the atmosphere. Plant species are chosen for phytoremediation based on their potential for rapid absorption of water through evapotranspiration, the degradative enzymes they produce, their growth rate and yield, the depth of their root zone, and their ability to bioaccumulate contaminants. Phytoremediation has been chosen as a remedial option for treatment of the groundwater in the X-749/X-120 area. The hybrid poplar tree (Populus sp.) was chosen for the application as a result of its high growth rate and yield, high evapotranspiration rates, root zone depth, long life span, and ease of growth. The phytoremediation system of 2,640 poplar trees has been planted in seven areas/zones to manage the volatile organic compound (VOC) contaminant plume. Currently the groundwater contains levels of TCE that are above-the targeted risk level. The objective of this task is to remove contamination from the groundwater, and prevent further migration of contaminants from the X-749 Landfill. The goal of the remediation procedure is to achieve a completely mature and functional phytoremediation system within two years of the initial planting of the hybrid poplar trees. Phytoremediation is a promising clean-up solution for a wide variety of pollutants and sites. Phytoremediation is a passive technology producing no waste during tree installation or during remediation. Mature trees can consume up to 3,000 gallons of groundwater per acre per day. Organic compounds are captured in the trees' root systems. These organic compounds are degraded by ultraviolet light as they are transpired along with the water vapor through the leaves of the trees. Phytoremediation is an in situ technology that produces an aesthetically pleasing environment, and is entirely solar driven, which provides high public acceptance. The plants are normally sold for profit after project completion and the soil remains in place and is reusable following treatment. Phytoremediation is 10% to 20% less costly than mechanical treatments, regarding overall operating costs. Copyright © 2005 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Reduction of soluble uranium U(VI) to less-soluble uranium U(IV) is a promising approach to minimize migration from contaminated aquifers. It is generally assumed that, under constant reducing conditions, U(IV) is stable and immobile; however, in a previous study, we documented reoxidation of U(IV) under continuous reducing conditions (Wan et al., Environ. Sci. Technol. 2005, 39:6162-6169). To determine if changes in microbial community composition were a factor in U(IV) reoxidation, we employed a high-density phylogenetic DNA microarray (16S microarray) containing 500,000 probes to monitor changes in bacterial populations during this remediation process. Comparison of the 16S microarray with clone libraries demonstrated successful detection and classification of most clone groups. Analysis of the most dynamic groups of 16S rRNA gene amplicons detected by the 16S microarray identified five clusters of bacterial subfamilies responding in a similar manner. This approach demonstrated that amplicons of known metal-reducing bacteria such as Geothrix fermentans (confirmed by quantitative PCR) and those within the Geobacteraceae were abundant during U(VI) reduction and did not decline during the U(IV) reoxidation phase. Significantly, it appears that the observed reoxidation of uranium under reducing conditions occurred despite elevated microbial activity and the consistent presence of metal-reducing bacteria. High-density phylogenetic microarrays constitute a powerful tool, enabling the detection and monitoring of a substantial portion of the microbial population in a routine, accurate, and reproducible manner.

	abstract = {Heavy metal environmental contaminants cannot be destroyed but require containment, preferably in concentrated form, in a solid or immobile form for recycling or final disposal. Microorganisms are able to take up and deposit high levels of contaminant metals, including radioactive metals such as uranium and plutonium, into their cell wall. Consequently, these microbial systems are of great interest as the basis for potential environmental bioremediation technologies. The outer membranes of Gram-negative microbes are highly nonsymmetric and exhibit a significant electrostatic potential gradient across the membrane. This gradient has a significant effect on the uptake and transport of charged and dipolar compounds. However, the effectiveness of microbial systems for environmental remediation will depend strongly on specific properties that determine the uptake of targeted contaminants by a particular cell wall. To aid in the design of microbial remediation technologies, knowledge of the factors that determine the affinity of a particular bacterial outer membrane for the most common ionic species found in contaminated soils and groundwater is of great importance. Using our previously developed model for the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) membrane of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, this work presents the potentials of mean force as the estimate of the free energy profile for uptake of sodium, calcium, chloride, uranyl ions, and a water molecule by the bacterial LPS membrane. A compatible classical parameter set for uranyl has been developed and validated. Results show that the uptake of uranyl is energetically a favorable process relative to the other ions studied. At neutral pH, this nuclide is shown to be retained on the surface of the LPS membrane through chelation with the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups located in the outer core. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Background, Aims and Scope. The management and decisions concerning restoration of contaminated land often require in-depth risk analyses. An environmental risk assessment is generally described as proceeding in four separate steps: hazard identification, dose-response assessment, exposure assessment, and risk characterization. The risk assessment should acknowledge and quantify the uncertainty in risk predictions. This can be achieved by applying probabilistic methods which, although they have been available for many years, are still not generally used. Risk assessment of contaminated land is an area where probabilistic methods have proved particularly useful. Many reports have appeared in the literature, mostly by North American researchers. The aim of this review is to summarize the experience gained so far, provide a number of useful examples, and suggest what may be done to promote probabilistic methods in Europe and the rest of the world. Methods. The available literature has been explored through searches in the major scientific and technical databases, WWW resources, textbooks and direct contacts with active researchers. A calculation example was created using standard simulation software. Results and Discussion. Uncertainty and variability are part of every risk assessment. Much work on risks from contaminated soil has focussed on exposure, and choice and structure of the exposure model is then a basic uncertainty factor. Other factors, e.g. parameter uncertainty, are easier to characterize. Variability can be separated into inter-individual, spatial and temporal components. Both uncertainty and variability in the exposure variables can be investigated using Monte Carlo simulation methods. These simulations enable not only the estimation of the probability for a given risk or exposure, but also add information on the sensitivity of the various input variables. This will assist the assessor in further refining the risk analysis. The large number of applications published encompasses soil contamination by lead, arsenic, chromium, uranium, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), hexachlorobenzene, pentachlorophenol and chlorinated solvents. Probabilistic risk assessments have been used in widely different settings, such as the metallurgical industry (mining and smelting operations), manufacturing, gas plants, wood impregnation, infrastructure, and waste landfills. Site-specific remediation goals can be specified using probabilistic methods, and a guideline document has been issued within the US Superfund programme. The usability of probabilistic risk assessment is illustrated by a calculation example. The current Swedish generic guideline value for benzo[a]pyrene in contaminated soil, with ingestion of vegetables as the major route of exposure, is compared with a probabilistic estimate. The toxicological reference value corresponds well with the upper 95th percentile of the estimated variability in intake, but does not account for uncertainty in the partition coefficients. Conclusions and Outlook. The probabilistic approach to risk assessment has proved its value in characterizing variability and uncertainty, and thereby contributing to a more informed and transparent decision-making process. The management of contaminated land is a major environmental application for probabilistic risk assessments. A substantial number of studies have been published and the method is now well established in the scientific community. This development has progressed further in the United States than elsewhere, but similar applications are now being reported from Europe and Asia. Probabilistic risk assessment is used to derive soil guideline values in the United Kingdom, and other countries may be anticipated to follow. However, efficient use of probabilistic methods for risk assessment of contaminated land requires certain components. There is a requirement for quality assurance and transparency that can be met by guidelines specifying data requirements and which items to report on. Both federal and state governments in the United States have issued such guidelines, and we see a similar need from a European perspective. A second component, necessary for a successful implementation of probabilistic methods, is education. We have ourselves developed undergraduate curricula, but we also see a need for continuous education of risk assessors and decision makers. The third component required is case studies, showing how probabilistic risk assessment can be implemented successfully in the cleanup of contaminated land. Most published studies originate from the United States, so here too there is a need for the rest of the world to catch up. In addition to the three components mentioned, there is an obvious need to develop and improve methods and practice of risk communication. © 2005 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).},

	abstract = {Tetravalentactinides are often considered environmentally immobile due to their strong hydrolysis and formation of sparingly soluble oxide phases. However, biogenic ligands commonly found in the soil environment may increase their solubility and mobility. We studied the adsorption and dissolution kinetics of UO2 in the presence of a microbial siderophore, desferrioxamine-B (DFO-B), under reducing conditions. Using batch and continuous flow stirred tank reactors (CFSTR), we found that OFO-B increases the solubility of UIV and accelerates UO2 dissolution rates through a ligand-promoted dissolution mechanism. OFO-B adsorption to UO 2 followed a Langmuir-type isotherm. The maximum adsorbed DFO-B concentrations were 3.3 μmol-2 between pH 3 and 8 and declined above pH 8. OFO-B dissolved UO2 at a OFO-B surface-saturated net rate of 64 nmol h-1 m-2 (pH 7.5, I = 0.01 M) according to the first-order rate equation R = kL[Lads], with a rate coefficient kL of 0.019 h-1. Even at very low siderophore concentrations (e.g. 1 μM), net dissolution rates (16 nmol h-1 m-2, pH 7.5, I = 0.01 M) were substantially greaterthan net proton-promoted dissolution rates (3 nmol h-1 m-2, pH 7-7.5, I = 0.01 M). Interestingly, adding dissolved FeIII had negligible effects on DFO-B-promoted UO2 dissolution rates, despite its potential as a competitor for DFO-B and as an oxidant of UIV. Our results suggest that strong organic ligands could influence the environmental mobility of tetravalent actinides and should be considered in predictions for nuclear waste storage and remediation strategies. © 2005 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Building 14, a structure impacted by World War II era nuclear material refinement, required dismantlement in 2004 at the Linde Site Remediation project in Tonawanda, New York. The challenge for the project and facility team was to accomplish replacement of a utility tunnel, including relocated infrastructure installation, in less than 17 months to allow Building 14 dismantlement to start on time without causing adverse impact to a co-located facility's operations. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USAGE) - Buffalo District contracted Shaw Environmental, Inc. (Shaw) to remediate uranium ore refinement waste residuum, uranium-238 (U-238), thorium-230 (Th-230), and radium-226 (Ra-226), at the Linde Site as part of the Formerly Used Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP). Due to spatial limitations at the facility, a substantial portion of the new tunnel's footprint was in areas contaminated with more than 4,500 metric tons of low-level radiological material, and remedial action had to precede the new tunnel installation. Also, the host facility's operations depended upon uninterrupted function of multiple utility systems contained within a service tunnel running under Building 14. Meeting the challenge started by designing the replacement utility tunnel using a multi-disciplinary team of engineers. The new tunnel was to be constructed below surrounding grade in a shored open excavation located in a narrow vehicular corridor between two 60-year old, multi-story masonry and steel buildings. Systems design was completed for 20 separate utility systems. Execution of the design required a skilled craft labor force to work seamlessly with radiation safety personnel and facility managers. Schedule and logistic constraints required development of a unique procedure to sequence trench excavation with radioactive waste removal, radiation survey, and tunnel construction activities within feet of one another. Shaw excavated and packaged soil impacted by the radioactive materials for shipment and cleared the area via final status survey procedures prior to tunnel installation. Health physics personnel developed site-specific radiation survey and sampling procedures to clear soil, steel, and concrete surfaces in as quickly as 4 hours following waste removal. Design was initiated in February of 2003. Construction started in September 2003 and proceeded through the winter for successful completion in June 2004. More than 20,000 manhours were applied to the work without a lost time accident. The completed cost for the work, less waste transportation and disposal, was $2,300,000. The details and methods define the nature of the challenges and magnitude of success for the team as Building 14 dismantlement began on schedule. Copyright © 2005 by ASME.},

	abstract = {To investigate the efficiency of the phytoremediation of uraniumcontaminated soil by Brassica juncea and Helianthus annuus, greenhouse experiments with both plant species and soil from the "Fuhrberger Feld" (near Hanover, Germany) with defined enhancement of the uranium concentrations up to approximately 6 mg kg-1 have been carried out. Part of the test plants was treated with citric acid buffer (pH =4.8). Plants of both species were grown in soil from the "Fuhrberger Feld" without any treatment (control plants). The plants were harvested 13 weeks after settling and the uranium concentration in shoots and roots and the remaining soil was measured. The uptake of uranium into the shoot was clearly lower than into the roots. Uranium concentration in the shoots of the control plants was below the detection limit. The addition of the citric acid buffer caused an enhancement of the uranium concentration in the soil water by factors of up to approximately 80. A visible effect of this enhanced concentration on the uptake into the plant and on the distribution on shoot and root was only shown for Brassica juncea, where the concentration in the shoot doubled. The reverse effect was shown for Helianthus annuus, where the citric acid buffer treatment caused a lower concentration in roots and shoots compared to the untreated soil with the same uranium concentration. Generally, the uranium uptake into the plants was very low (<1 pg per plant) for all experiments. The results of these plant experiments point out that the effectiveness of uranium uptake into plants cannot be increased by citric acid buffer treatment in every case, even if the uranium concentration in soil solution is increased considerably. No decrease of uranium concentration in soil due to the uptake into plants could be shown. Thus a special suitability of Brassica juncea and Helianthus annuus for phytoremediation could not be proven.},

	abstract = {The oxidation status of uranium in sediments is important because the solubility of this toxic and radioactive element is much greater for U(VI) than for U(IV) species. Thus, redox manipulation to promote precipitation of UO 2 is receiving interest as a method to remediate U-contaminated sediments. Presence of Fe and Mn oxides in sediments at much higher concentrations than U requires an understanding of their redox status as well. This study was conducted to determine changes in oxidation states of U, Fe, and Mn in U-contaminated sediments from Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Oxidation states of these elements were measured in real-time and nondestructively using X-ray absorption spectroscopy on sediment columns supplied with synthetic groundwater containing organic carbon (OC, 0, 3, 10, 30, and 100 mM OC as lactate) for over 400 days. In sediments supplied with OC ≥ 30 mM, 80% of the U was reduced to U(IV), with transient reoxidation at about 150 days. Mn(III,IV) oxides were completely reduced to Mn(II) in sediments infused with OC ≥ 3 mM. However, Fe remained largely unreduced in all sediment columns, showing that Fe(III) can persist as an electron acceptor in reducing sediments over long times. This result in combination with the complete reduction of all other potential electron acceptors supports the hypothesis that the reactive Fe(III) fraction was responsible for reoxidizing U(IV). © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Chelate-assisted phytoextraction has been proposed as a potential tool for phytoremediation of U contaminated sites. In this context, the effects of five biodegradable amendments on U release in contaminated soils were evaluated. Three soils were involved in this study, one with a relatively high background level of U, and two which were contaminated with U from industrial effluents. Soils were treated with 5 mmol kg- 1 dry weight of either citric acid, NH4-citrate/citric acid, oxalic acid, S,S-ethylenediamine disuccinic acid or nitrilotriacetic acid. Soil solution concentration of U was monitored during 2 weeks. All amendments increased U concentration in soil solution, but citric acid and NH4-citrate/citric acid mixture were most effective, with up to 479-fold increase. For oxalic acid, S,S-ethylenediamine disuccinic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid, the increase ranged from 10-to 100-fold. The highest concentrations were observed 1 to 7 days after treatment, after which U levels in soil solution gradually decreased. All amendments induced a temporary increase of soil solution pH and TOC that could not be correlated with the release of U in the soil solution. Thermodynamic stability constants (log K) of complexes did not predict the relative efficiency of the selected biodegradable amendments on U release in soil solution. Amendments efficiency was better predicted by the relative affinity of the chelate for Fe compared to U. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Numerical modeling is a critical tool to the U.S. Department of Energy for evaluating the environmental impact of remediation strategies for subsurface legacy waste sites. Unfortunately, the physical and chemical complexity of many sites overwhelms the capabilities of even most state of the art groundwater models. Of particular concern is the representation of highly-heterogeneous stratified rock/soil layers in the subsurface and the biological and geochemical interactions of chemical species within multiple fluid phases. There is clearly a need for higher-resolution modeling (i.e. increased spatial and temporal resolution) and increasingly mechanistic descriptions of subsurface physicochemical processes (i.e. increased chemical degrees of freedom). We present SciDAC-funded research being performed in furthering the development of PFLOTRAN, a parallel multiphase flow and multicomponent reactive transport model. Written in Fortran90, PFLOTRAN is founded upon PETSc data structures and solvers. We are employing PFLOTRAN to simulate uranium transport at the Hanford 300 Area, a contaminated site of major concern to the Department of Energy, the State of Washington, and other government agencies. By leveraging the billions of degrees of freedom available through high-performance computation using tens of thousands of processors, we can better characterize the release of uranium into groundwater and its subsequent transport to the Columbia River, and thereby better understand and evaluate the effectiveness of various proposed remediation strategies. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The soil was characterized by a slightly alkaline pH (7.8) and a significant positive net neutralization potential (240 kg CaCO3/t). The treatment was connected with the dissolution of pollutants and their removal from the soil by means of solution of Na2CO3 and NaHCO3. The dissolution was connected mainly with the activity of some heterotrophic microorganisms as well as of some basophilic chemolithotrophic bacteria. This activity was enhanced by suitable changes in the levels of some essential environmental factors such as water, oxygen and nutrient contents in the soil. The removal of pollutants was efficient and within 18 months their residual concentrations were decreased below the relevant permissible levels. The soil effluents containing the dissolved contaminants were treated efficiently by means of a natural wetland located near the experimental plot.},

	abstract = {Modern approaches for bioremediation of radionuclide contaminated environments are based on the ability of microorganisms to effectively catalyze changes in the oxidation states of metals that in turn influence their solubility. Although microbial metal reduction has been identified as an effective means for immobilizing highly-soluble uranium(VI) complexes in situ, the biomolecular mechanisms of U(VI) reduction are not well understood. Here, we show that c-type cytochromes of a dissimilatory metal-reducing bacterium, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, are essential for the reduction of U(VI) and formation of extracelluar UO2 nanoparticles. In particular, the outer membrane (OM) decaheme cytochrome MtrC (metal reduction), previously implicated in Mn(IV) and Fe(III) reduction, directly transferred electrons to U(VI). Additionally, deletions of mtrC and/or omcA significantly affected the in vivo U(VI) reduction rate relative to wild-type MR-1. Similar to the wild-type, the mutants accumulated UO2 nanoparticles extracellularly to high densities in association with an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). In wild-type cells, this UO2-EPS matrix exhibited glycocalyx-like properties and contained multiple elements of the OM, polysaccharide, and heme-containing proteins. Using a novel combination of methods including synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence microscopy and high-resolution immune-electron microscopy, we demonstrate a close association of the extracellular UO2 nanoparticles with MtrC and OmcA (outer membrane cytochrome). This is the first study to our knowledge to directly localize the OM-associated cytochromes with EPS, which contains biogenic UO2 nanoparticles. In the environment, such association of UO2 nanoparticles with biopolymers may exert a strong influence on subsequent behavior including susceptibility to oxidation by O2 or transport in soils and sediments. © 2006 Marshall et al.},

	abstract = {Background. Recent studies indicated that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) play important roles in plant accumulation of uranium (U) from contaminated environments, but the impacts of fertilization practices on functioning of the symbiotic associations, which are crucial factors influencing plant nutrition and growth responses to mycorrhiza, have rarely been considered. Materials and Methods. In a greenhouse experiment, a bald root barley mutant (brb) together with the wild type (wt) were used to test the role of root hairs and AMF in uranium (U) uptake by host plants from a U contaminated soil. Nil, 20 and 60 mg KH2PO4-P kg-1 soil were included to investigate the influences of phosphorus (P) fertilization on plant growth and accumulation of U. Results. Dry matter yield of barley plants increased with increasing P additions and wt produced significantly higher dry weight than brb. Mycorrhiza markedly improved dry matter yield of both genotypes grown at nil P, whereas only brb responded positively to mycorrhiza at 20 mg P kg-1. At the highest P level, mycorrhiza resulted in growth depressions in both genotypes, except for the roots of wt. In general, plant P concentrations increased markedly with increasing P additions and in response to mycorrhiza. Mycorrhiza and P additions had no significant effects on shoot U concentrations. However, root U concentrations in both genotypes were significantly increased by mycorrhiza. On the other hand, shoot U contents increased with increasing P levels, while 20 mg P kg-1 stimulated, but 60 mg P kg-1 marginally affected the U accumulation in roots. Root length specific U uptake was moderately enhanced both by root hairs and strongly enhanced by mycorrhiza. Moreover, non-inoculated plants generally had higher shoot-root ratios of U content than the corresponding inoculated controls. Conclusion. Our study shows that AMF and root hairs improves not only P acquisition but also the root uptake of U, and mycorrhiza generally decreases U translocation from plant root to shoot. Hence, mycorrhiza is of potential use in the phytostabilization of U contaminated environments. Perspectives. The complex impacts of P on U accumulation by barley plants suggested that U behavior in mycorrhizosphere and translocation along the soil-fungi-plant continuum as affected by fertilization practices deserve extensive studies for optimizing the function of mycorrhizal associations for phytoremediation purposes. © 2005 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).},

	abstract = {Amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide is being used to treat groundwater contaminated with uranium(VI); the compound also has potential for use as a component in in situ chemical barriers. To quantitatively evaluate its effectiveness in such applications, adsorption of uranium(VI) onto amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide was experimentally investigated under a wide range of uranium(VI) (8.40·10-7-2.10·10-3 mol L-1; 0.2-500 mg L-1), sulfur(VI) (0-0.07 mol L-1; 0-2240 mg L-1) and carbon(IV) (0-0.0195 mol L-1; 0-234 mg L-1) concentrations, and pH-values (4-9.6). The adsorption behavior of uranium(VI) (uranyl ion and its complexes) is similar to that of other cations; it exhibits a sharp rise in the extent of adsorption with increasing pH. Interactions among uranyl complexes and surface sites are interpreted using a site complexation model. Although the model does not incorporate electrostatics and includes only a single type of adsorption site, it provides a reasonable match to measured adsorption and proton exchange data. The simplicity of the model and the resulting reduction in computational demand allow its efficient incorporation into coupled reaction-transport models. © 1995.},

	abstract = {Dissolved carbonate species are known to affect the sorption behavior of trace species. The macroscopic description of these interactions with a thermodynamic approach has been limited by the lack of data on the binary interaction between carbonate and relevant mineral surfaces. This work follows from two detailed studies of carbonate adsorption on goethite (4, 13). It shows that independent triple-layer surface complexation modeling (TLM) of carbonate adsorption allows successful descriptions of carbonate-trace element ternary sorption on this oxide, using relatively simple and optimal stoichiometries. Carbonate adsorption was considerably enhanced in the presence of Pb(II), despite an invariant total Pb(II) sorption to equilibration with up to 1% CO2(g). Both the Pb(II)-carbonate system behavior and the anion-like pH adsorption behavior of U(VI) in the presence of CO2 were successfully modeled using binary and ternary metal-bound surface complexes. The significant reduction of Cr(VI) adsorption edges to lower pH values in the presence of CO2 was accurately simulated and explained via site competition and surface electrostatic repulsion effects on the predicted inner- and outer-sphere Cr(VI) surface complexes formed. The results of this research are highly relevant to modeling of metal transport field data and of potential soil remediation schemes using carbonate.},

In situ distribution coefficients, or Kd values (Kd = Csolid/Cliquid), were determined. Sequential extraction data were used to assign solid-phase radionuclide concentrations (Csolid) that, by definition, should represent only the reversibly sorbed fraction. A series of selective and sequential extractions was used to determine desorption Kd values. Thorium Kd values ranged from 115 to 2255 ml/g. Uranium Kd values ranged from 170 to 6493 ml/g. Compared to sorption Kd values, these desorption Kd values were appreciably greater because they captured the "aging" process of the radionuclides with the sediment, making the radionuclide more refractory. Compared to nonsite-specific data, these in situ Kd values improved accuracy, were more defensible, and removed unnecessary conservatism for subsequent transport and risk calculations. Additional tests were conducted to provide geochemical information relevant for selecting appropriate remediation technologies for the contaminated site. Thorium and uranium were associated with labile fractions and were not concentrated with the smaller sediment particles. These findings suggest that phytoremediation or heap leaching, and not soil washing, are viable remediation approaches for this site.},

The system water/soil was amended with lactate and phosphate for bacterial growth. Nitrate and sulfate were added to stimulate the growth of indigenous denitrifying and sulfate-reducing bacteria. During denitrification Tc-concentration did not change with time. In the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria, Tc-concentrations decreased in reacted waters which could be attributed to Tc(VII) reduction and precipitation of TcO2 and/or TcS2. Coprecipitation with newly formed iron sulfide is expected to contribute to Tc removal. Additional experiments with U and Tc showed that these elements were simultaneously reduced by sulfate-reducing bacteria. This work shows that 1) subsurface mixed cultures of denitrifying bacteria do not remove Tc from solution, this is different from uranium and 2) sulfate-reducing bacteria reduce and remove Tc from aqueous solutions and thus in situ bioremediation of subsurface waters and soils may be possible with such ubiquitous bacteria.},

Important issues in dealing with such contamination include the assessment of the potential health risks associated with human exposures to the residual uranium and the determination of safe levels of U in soils that have been treated by a given technology. This paper reviews pertinent aspects of the health risks posed by uranium in soils and discusses various methodological considerations that must be dealt with in developing cleanup limits for U in treated soils. Of special concern is the development of remediation limits that are closely tied to a set of monitoring requirements for determining compliance with derived limits. Key issues addressed include characterization of the bioavailability of uranium compounds in food and water, determination of a safe level of uranium in kidney tissue, estimation of the health risks associated with the uranium daughter products radium and radon, assessment of the potential for ground-water contamination, biogeochemical characterization of soil-treatment processes, and specification of appropriate monitoring and statistical protocols for analyzing treated and untreated soils. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

	abstract = {High levels of heavy metals have been found in the surroundings of the closed uranium (U) mine in Ranstad in southern Sweden. These findings cannot be explained entirely by abiotic processes. It was not until recently that biology was taken into account in the discussion about mobilization of metals at this site. It is well known that bacteria produce short-chain organic acids and element-specific ligands (siderophores) that are able to change pH and enhance chelation, which results in increased mobilization of many trace elements. Other (nonessential) elements, such as thallium (Tl), lanthanides, and actinides, may also be mobilized as a result of such bacterial action. This paper describes the mobilization of U and other elements from U ores by bacteria. Three common siderophore-producing bacterial species, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Shewanella putrefaciens and Pseudomonas stutzeri, were incubated in a chemically defined medium supplemented with tailings material with a content of 0.0013% U by weight, which had been exposed to natural weathering for 30 years. Nonleached U ore (0.61% U by weight) from the same area was incubated with P. fluorescens and S. putrefaciens for comparison. P. fluorescens grown with ore caused a change in pH in the growth medium from 4.7 to 9.3, which was significantly higher than for the other two species, for which pH was about 5.2. P. fluorescens was the only species that thrived and mobilized measurable amounts of U from the two ores, leaching out 0.001-0.005% of the total amount of U from both. The release of U is attributed to the production of pyoverdine chelators, since U could not be detected either in sterile controls or in the experiments with the other two bacteria. P. fluorescens also doubled the chromium (Cr) concentration in solution as compared with the sterile controls, whereas P. stutzeri and S. putrefaciens caused a five to sixfold increase in Cr concentration. Thallium, cobalt (Co), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and vanadium (V) concentrations initially resembled those in the sterile controls, but from day 2 of the experiment, a decrease was observed. The difference in leaching behavior between the bacteria used in this study is likely to have been due to the production of different chelators rather than being an effect of pH, since many metals have low solubility at neutral to alkaline pH. This study using laboratory incubations shows that mobilization of U from ore can occur aerobically at neutral to alkaline conditions, which may be an important process behind the high content of heavy metals in the surroundings of the closed U mine at Ranstad. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Physicochemical and mineralogical properties of the contaminants should be taken into account to decide a remediation strategy for a given radionuclide because development and optimization of soil remedial technologies are based on physicochemical and mineralogical separation techniques. The objectives of this study are to (1) demonstrate how a priori physicochemical and mineralogical characterization of soil contaminants can direct the development of remediation strategies and their performance evaluation for soil treatments and (2) understand the nature of uranium contamination and its association with the soil matrix by chemical extractions. This study examined two U-contaminated sites (K311 and K1300) at the DOE K-25 site, presently located at East Tennessee Technology Park, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Uranium concentrations of the soils ranged from 1499 to 216,413 Bq kg-1 at both sites. Scanning electron microscopy with backscattered electron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the dominant U phases are U oxides (schoepite), U-Ca-silicate (uranophane) and U silicate (coffinite) from the K311 site soils, whereas U-Ca-oxide and U-Ca-phosphate dominate in the K1300 site soils. Sodium carbonate/bicarbonate leaching was effective on the K1300 site soils, whereas citric acid leaching is effective on the K311 site soils. Sequential leaching showed that the majority of the uranium in the contaminated soils was contained in carbonate minerals (45%) and iron oxides (40%). Conventional leaching showed that citric acid treatment was most effective on the K311 site soils, whereas the sodium carbonate/bicarbonate treatment was most effective on the K1300 site soils.},

	abstract = {Plutonium partitioning within a bulk, freshwater sediment and to specific size fractions of the sediment was determined. Fission track analysis was used to observe the spatial heterogeneity of fissile isotopes of Pu and U in the sediment. For the bulk sediment, a six-step sequential extraction scheme was used to elucidate Pu partitioning. Although no direct Pu speciation is obtained from our sequential extraction scheme, this study demonstrates that the partitioning information obtained is more useful for evaluating ex-situ remediation treatments than information obtained from complete digestion and analysis of the bulk sediment. The majority of 238Pu and 239+240Pu appear to be partitioned in the oxidizable fraction; suggesting that Pu is primarily associated with organic matter in the bulk sediment or may exist as a discrete, oxidizable phase. By varying filter pore size used to separate the sequential extraction leachate solution from the remaining solid phase, a fraction of 238Pu associated with colloidal material was observed, and chemical evidence suggests that this colloidal material is relatively refractory. Pu partitioning to various size fractions of the bulk sediment was also compared to the percent organic carbon present in those size fractions. Interestingly, little correlation was observed between the percentage of organic carbon and concentrations of Pu isotopes in the various size fractions, although differences were observed in the distributions of 238Pu versus 239+240Pu in the size fractions. These results suggest that other sediment phases may also be important for Pu partitioning. Our observations are described in the context of feasibility of various remediation options.},

The goals of the present study are to (1) provide fundamental information regarding uptake of U by plants; and (2) improve the phytoextraction of U from contaminated soil. The first was achieved through speciation modeling and hydroponic experiments that demonstrated that the uranyl (UO22+) cation is the chemical species of U most readily accumulated in plant shoots. A subsequent soil incubation experiment examined the solubilizationof U from contaminated soil by synthetic chelates and organic acids. The results indicated that citric acid solubilized >100 times more U than the other amendments. The results of the hydroponic and soil experiments were then integrated in a study that grew red beets in U-contaminated soils amended with citric acid or N-hydroxylethylene diamine triacetic acid. Citric acid was again a highly effective amendment, increasing shoot U content by 14-fold compared to controls. In addition to providing fundamental information regarding the uptake of U by plants, this study illustrates the importance of basic research to phytoremediation.},

	abstract = {The fission yield of 99Tc from 239Pu and 235U is similar to that of 137Cs or 90Sr and it is therefore an important component of nuclear weapons fall-out, nuclear waste and releases from nuclear facilities. There is particular current interest in 99Tc transfer from soil to plants for: (a) environmental impact assessments for terrestrial nuclear waste repositories, and (b) assessments of the potential for phytoextraction of radionuclides from contaminated effluent and soil. Vascular plants have a high 99Tc uptake capacity, a strong tendency to transport it to shoot material and accumulate it in vegetative rather than reproductive structures. The mechanisms that control 99Tc entry to plants have not been identified and there has been little discussion of the potential for phytoextraction of 99Tc contaminated effluents or soil. Here we review soil availability, plant uptake mechanisms and soil to plant transfer of 99Tc in the light of recent advances in soil science, plant molecular biology and phytoextraction technologies. We conclude that 99Tc might not be highly available in the long term from up to 50% of soils worldwide, and that no single mechanism that might be easily targeted by recombinant DNA technologies controls 99Tc uptake by plants. Overall, we suggest that Tc might be less available in terrestrial ecosystems than is often assumed but that nevertheless the potential of phytoextraction as a decontamination strategy is probably greater for 99Tc than for any other nuclide of radioecological interest. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Laboratory experiments carried out with soil samples from these lands revealed that an efficient remediation of the soils was achieved by an in situ treatment method based on the activity of the indigenous soil microflora. The treatment was connected with the dissolution of the contaminants in the upper soil horizons and their transfer into the deeply located soil horizons (mainly to the horizon B2) where they were immobilized as different insoluble compounds. The dissolution of contaminants was connected with the activity of both heterotrophic and chemolithotrophic aerobic microorganisms and the immobilization was due mainly to the anaerobic sulphate-reducing bacteria. The activity of these microorganisms was enhanced by suitable changes in the levels of some essential environmental factors such as water, oxygen and nutrient contents in the soil. On the basis of the above-mentioned laboratory results, the method was then applied under real field conditions in a heavily contaminated experimental plot of land located in the Vromos Bay area. Within 8 months of treatment, the contents of radioactive elements and toxic heavy metals in the soil were decreased below the relevant permissible levels.},

This study determined whether potential risks are likely to remain minimal, identified data gaps, and recommended a long-term plan. A high-level analysis was conducted in conjunction with risk estimations to determine sensitivity of risks to uncertainties associated with radionuclide concentrations or radiation levels in exposure media including gamma radiation, radon, soil, water, and consumption of wild game/fish. Potential human health risks under current conditions are minimal under any conceivable exposure scenario. Recommendations for long-term monitoring focus on the exposure pathways of greatest concern, combined with the feasibility of further data collection.},

	abstract = {The Königstein Uranium Mine was closed in 1990, ending uranium production in the former GDR. As a result of the mining operation, a dump of about 4×l06 m3 was left at Schüsselgrund valley near Königstein. As part of the reclamation of the mine and the dump, abandoned equipment, radioactive soil, and building wastes will have to be disposed of. The vol aim of this investigation was to define the characteristics of the abandoned materials and mine wastes in order to identify a suitable remediation approach for these materials. It was important to evaluate their long-term behaviour in order to determine if it would be safe to dispose of the abandoned materials in the Schüsselgrund mine dump before closing and covering it. After in-situ remediation of the dump, groundwater will become the most important pathway for the migration of radioactive and toxic contaminants into the environment. If the disposal of the abandoned materials significantly increases the risk of contaminant potential or release, safer disposal strategies will have to be found. The investigation focused on the potential geochemical interactions, the mineralogical characteristics, and the time scales of fixation/release of contaminants from the wastes. To evaluate chemical interactions of contaminants and dump material, a total of 19 columns and 5 field tests were installed. Experiences from three years of experiments are reported. © IMWA Springer-Verlag 2001.},

Bicarbonate (100 mM) extracted 20-94% of the uranium that was extracted with nitric acid. The U(VI)-reducing microorganism, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans reduced the U(VI) to U(IV) in the bicarbonate extracts. In some instances unidentified dissolved extracted components, presumably organics, gave the extract a yellow color and inhibited U(VI) reduction and/or the precipitation of U(IV). Removal of the dissolved yellow material with the addition of hydrogen peroxide alleviated this inhibition. These results demonstrate that bicarbonate extraction of uranium from soil followed by microbial U(VI) reduction might be an effective mechanism for concentrating uranium from some contaminated soils. © 1995 Society for Industrial Microbiology.},

We investigated U(VI) reduction in groundwaters and soils of different origin to verify the presence of bacteria capable of U(VI) reduction. The groundwaters originated from mill tailings sites with U concentrations as high as 50 mg/l, and from other sites where uranium is not a contaminant, but was added in the laboratory to reach concentrations up to 11 mg/l. All waters contained nitrate and sulfate. After oxygen and nitrate reduction, U(VI) was reduced by sulfate-reducing bacteria, whose growth was stimulated by ethanol and trimetaphosphate. Uranium precipitated as hydrated uraninite (UO2.xH2O). In the course of reduction of U(VI), Mn(IV) and Fe(III) from the soil were reduced as well. During uraninite precipitation a comparatively large mass of iron sulfides formed and served as a redox buffer. If the excess of iron sulfide is large enough, uraninite will not be oxidized by oxygenated groundwater. We show that bacteria capable of reducing U(VI) to U(IV) are ubiquitous in nature. The uranium reducers are primarily sulfate reducers and are stimulated by adding nutrients to the groundwater. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {Numerous sites in the United States and around the world are contaminated with depleted uranium (DU) in various forms. A prevalent form is fragmented DU originating from various scientific tests involving high explosives and DU during weapon development programs, at firing practice ranges, or war theaters where DU was used in armor-piercing projectiles. The contamination at these sites is typically very heterogeneous, with discreet, visually identifiable DU fragments mixed with native soil. That is, the bulk-averaged DU activity is quite low, while specific DU fragments, which are distinct from the soil matrix, have much higher specific activity. DU is best known as a dark, black metal that is nearly twice as dense as lead, but DU in the environment readily weathers (oxidizes) to a distinctive bright yellow color that is readily visible. While the specific activity (amount of radioactivity per mass of soil) of DU is relatively low and presents only a minor radiological hazard, the fact that it iS radioactive and visually identifiable makes it desirable to remove the DU 'contamination' from the environment. The typical approach to conducting this DU remediation is to use radiation detection instruments to identify the contaminant and Separate it from the adjacent soil, packaging it for disposal as radioactive waste. This process can be performed manually or by specialized, automated equipment. Alternatively, in certain situations a more cost-effective approach might be simple mechanical or gravimetric separation of the D U fragments from the host soil matrix. At SNL/NM, both the automated and simple mechanical approaches have recently been employed. This paper discusses the pros/cons of the two approaches.},

	abstract = {Stimulating microbial reduction of soluble U(VI) to insoluble U(IV) shows promise as a strategy for immobilizing uranium in uranium-contaminated subsurface environments. In order to learn more about which microorganisms might be involved in U(VI) reduction in situ, the changes in the microbial community when U(VI) reduction was stimulated with the addition of acetate were monitored in sediments from three different uranium-contaminated sites in the floodplain of the San Juan River in Shiprock, N.Mex. In all three sediments U(VI) reduction was accompanied by concurrent Fe(III) reduction and a dramatic enrichment of microorganisms in the family Geobacteraceae, which are known U(VI)- and Fe(III)-reducing microorganisms. At the point when U(VI) reduction and Fe(III) reduction were nearing completion, Geobacteraceae accounted for ca. 40% of the 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences recovered from the sediments with bacterial PCR primers, whereas Geobacteraceae accounted for fewer than 5% of the 16S rDNA sequences in control sediments that were not amended with acetate and in which U(VI) and Fe(III) reduction were not stimulated. Between 55 and 65% of these Geobacteraceae sequences were most similar to sequences from Desulfuromonas species, with the remainder being most closely related to Geobacter species. Quantitative analysis of Geobacteraceae sequences with most-probable-number PCR and TaqMan analyses indicated that the number of Geobacteraceae sequences increased from 2 to 4 orders of magnitude over the course of U(VI) and Fe(III) reduction in the acetate-amended sediments from the three sites. No increase in Geobacteraceae sequences was observed in control sediments. In contrast to the predominance of Geobacteraceae sequences, no sequences related to other known Fe(III)-reducing microorganisms were detected in sediments. These results compare favorably with an increasing number of studies which have demonstrated that Geobacteraceae are important components of the microbial community in a diversity of subsurface environments in which Fe(III) reduction is an important process. The combination of these results with the finding that U(VI) reduction takes place during Fe(III) reduction and prior to sulfate reduction suggests that Geobacteraceae will be responsible for much of the Fe(III) and U(VI) reduction during uranium bioremediation in these sediments.},

Adsorption of U(VI) on the iron-rich sand decreased in the presence of increasing concentrations of citrate. Adsorption of citrate to the sand was weak under most conditions studied. Several explanations for the adsorption behavior of U(VI) and citrate were investigated, including aqueous complexation of U(VI) by citrate, competition of U(VI) and citrate for adsorption sites, and extraction of Fe and Al from the sorbent surface by citrate (surface alteration). Although aqueous complexation of U(VI) by citrate may still play a significant role, both competitive adsorption and aqueous complexation proved to be inadequate explanations of the adsorption behavior. Both physical surface alteration (i.e., loss of surface area) and chemical surface alteration (i.e., change in the chemical composition of the sand surface) were investigated, with chemical surface alteration controlling the bulk of U(VI) adsorption. Considering these results, remediation schemes that involve organic complexing agents should address the possibility of surface alteration affecting radionuclide adsorption and mobility.},

In case of small contamination just above release levels, low-cost yet sufficiently efficient remedial measures are recommended. This study was executed to test if low-level U contaminated sandy soil from a nuclear fuel processing site could be phytoextracted in order to attain the required release limits. Two soils were tested: a control soil (317 Bq 238U kg -1) and the same soil washed with bicarbonate (69 Bq 238U kg-1). Ryegrass (Lolium perenne cv. Melvina) and Indian mustard (Brassica juncea cv. Vitasso) were used as test plants. The annual removal of soil activity by the biomass was less than 0.1%. The addition of citric acid (25 mmol kg-1) 1 week before the harvest increased U uptake up to 500-fold. With a ryegrass and mustard yield of 15,000 and 10,000 kg ha -1, respectively, up to 3.5% and 4.6% of the soil activity could be removed annually by the biomass. With a desired activity reduction level of 1.5 and 5 for the bicarbonate-washed and control soil, respectively, it would take 10-50 years to attain the release limit. However, citric acid addition resulted in a decreased dry weight production. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In the first step, the contaminated soil is separated from the clean soil using the Thermo Nuclean (a division of the Thermo NUtech company) Segmented Gate System (SGS). Contaminated soil proceeds via conveyor belt to a separate storage bin to await further processing, while uncontaminated soil is returned to its original location. From the 218 cubic yards of soil excavated from the test site at TA-33, only seven cubic yards were found to contain uranium contamination above the criterion release limit, yielding an initial waste volume reduction of 97 percent. Using the containerized vat leaching (CVL) method, a technique borrowed from the mining industry, the uranium was then removed from the reduced volume of contaminated soil.

There is an urgent need for remediation of this contamination in order to prevent its possible long-term effects not only on the population in the contaminated regions but also on the neighboring countries. Therefore, it is necessary that together with permanent monitoring of environmental contamination, we proceed with research and development on selection of cost effective remediation technology appropriate for large areas such as contaminated water and soil. Conventional remediation techniques: excavation, treatment (soil washing, chelating), conditioning and disposal as low-level radioactive waste are necessary for heavy contaminated sites. However, for a large area of contaminated soil and aquifer sediments in situ remediation is appealing since it is much less disruptive to the ecosystem and hydrology, reduces the risk of worker exposure during remediation and is typically less expensive than conventional technologies. In situ remediation involves minimizing the mobility of contaminants by transferring them to stable, nonlabile phases via chemically induced transformation. © 2017, CI and CEQ. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {On a former nuclear production site, CHC contamination occurred due to, inappropriate storage practice. Investigation of the CHC plume and hydraulic properties of the aquifer with a pump test indicated elevated uranium, arsenic, and MTBE concentrations. The uranium contamination was related to the former production activities on site, while the source of arsenic is understood to be geogenic. Additionally, the site was used as an ammunitions plant in WWI, which may have also caused an arsenic contamination to the soil. The input of MTBE occurred on an industrial upstream site. This paper discusses the field-scale pilot tests being conducted for evaluation of cost efficient treatment technologies for the remediation of the commingled contamination of CHC, MTBE, uranium, and arsenic in groundwater. Based on the results the final remediation system design consist of an air stripper with off-gas treatment for removal of CHC and MTBE, a selective ion-exchanger, based upon cellulose for adsorption of uranium after acidification to pH 4-5, and a filter with activated aluminum oxide for removal of arsenic.},

	abstract = {Soils contaminated with heavy metals or radionuclides at concentrations above regulatory limits pose an environmental and human health risk. Whereas regulatory limits are only concerned with the 'extent' of the contamination, knowledge of the 'nature' of the contamination (e.g., oxidation state and mineralogy of the contaminant, particulate vs. adsorbed form, etc.) is necessary for developing optimal treatment strategies. Mineralogical identification of the contaminants provides important information concerning the nature of the contamination because once the mineral form is known, its properties can then be determined from geochemical data. To this end, a new density-fractionation technique called the Magstream density separator was used to concentrate U particulates from U-contaminated soils at a former U.S. Department of Energy U-metal production facility. Results from neutron-activation analysis of each density fraction showed that the U had been concentrated (up to 11-fold) in the heavier fractions. Mineralogical analyses of the density fractions of these soils using x-ray diffraction, scanning-electron microscopy, and an electron microprobe showed the predominance of an autunite [Ca(UO2)2(PO4)2·10-12 H2O]like mineral with lesser amounts of uraninite (UO2) and coffinite (USiO4) as the U-bearing minerals in these soils. The presence of reduced forms of U in these soils suggests that the optimal remediation strategy requires treatment with an oxidizing agent in addition to a carbonate-based leachant to solubilize and remove U from these soils.},

In most experiments, more than 95% of added U(VI) was sorbed to solids, so that U(VI) reduction was governed by reactions at the solid-water interface. The rate and extent of reduction of U(VI) associated with surfaces of synthetic Fe(III) oxides (hydrous ferric oxide, goethite, and hematite) was comparable to that observed during reduction of aqueous U(VI). In contrast, microbial reduction of U(VI) sorbed to several different natural Fe(III) oxide-containing solids was slower and less extensive compared to synthetic Fe(III) oxide systems. Addition of the electron shuttling agent anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS; 0.1 mM) enhanced the rate and extent of both Fe(III) and U(VI) reduction. These findings suggest that AQDS facilitated electron transfer from G. sulfurreducens to U(VI) associated with surface sites atwhich direct enzymatic reduction was kinetically limited. Our results demonstrate that association of U(VI) with diverse surface sites in natural soils and sediments has the potential to limit the rate and extent of microbial U(VI) reduction and thereby modulate the effectiveness of in situ U(VI) bioremediation.},

A sequential extraction procedure was applied after heating the materials to assess the changes in each isotope's functional form among water-soluble, cation-exchangeable, acid-soluble, and residual phases. The overall immobilization effects were consistent with rapid high temperature ionic diffusion from the initially contaminated surfaces into the mineral matrices; subsequent diffusion out of mineral particles at ambient temperature, as measured by the sequential extraction behavior, would be such a slow process that the radionuclides may be considered sequestered from further potential environmental mobilization. In the Hanford soil, the effect was found to follow an Arrhenius-type relationship with treatment temperature up to 1000 °C for 57Co, 85Sr, and U, and immobilization was independent of previous thermal treatment of the materials. Although 134Cs exhibited its largest immobilization in the Hanford soil after heating to 1000 °C, the large immobilization of 134Cs at all temperature and even in unheated Hanford soil made it difficult to observe a strong temperature dependence. A general and promising technique for environmental remediation of contaminated soil by high-temperature heating without melting can be extrapolated directly from the empirical leaching information.},

	abstract = {Remediation of an uranium-mine soil from Settendorf (East Germany) includes phytoextraction under conditions which make its heavy metals more plant-available but less leachable. A second way is active inhibition of heavy metal uptake by the plant. In a pot trial with Chinese cabbage (Brassica chinensis L.), planted and unplanted soil samples were daily irrigated with deionized water or aqueous solutions with a total of (g (kg soil)-1) CaCl2 (0.26 Ca), NH4Cl (1.39), casein, sucrose, citric acid (13), and an extract of rape (B. napus L.) shoots (13 DW) in a phytotron for 26 d. Water-irrigated plants were also treated with a 50 mM citric acid solution (10.5 g (kg soil)-1) 6 and 7 d prior to harvesting. Total elements in plant tissue and soluble elements in aqueous extracts from control and postharvest soils were determined by ICP-AES. Supplements of NH 4+, and the NH4+-generating casein and rape extract reduced soil pH during nitrification, and increased plant uptake of Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn. Citric acid at 50 mM adjusted soil to pH 4.5-6.0 and enhanced uptake of all elements. Long-term application of sucrose and citric acid increased pH and inhibited uptake of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn. Contemporarily, leaching of heavy metals and humic substances was lowest with Ca and NH4+ and highest with sucrose and citric acid amendments. It is concluded that Chinese cabbage grown for chelate-assisted phytoextraction should be supplied with Ca and NH4+ to obtain a high plant biomass on soil with a low hazard of leaching. Metal uptake should be stimulated by application of chelator 7 d prior to harvesting. Undesired uptake of heavy metals by Chinese cabbage determined as food should be inhibited with carbohydrate amendments. Long-term application of NH 4+ or chelator, which reduces the solubility of certain elements but increases their uptake moderately, is recommended as a tool for continuous phytoextraction technologies.},

	abstract = {Risk assessment, both human and ecological, embodies fundamental assumptions about hydrological processes, especially how they affect the movement of contaminants in the environment. The lateral movement of water through the soil, or interflow, is frequently a component of risk assessments for humid environments, but not of those for semiarid environments. Our research has shown that, contrary to what was previously thought, interflow can be important in semiarid landscapes and is, therefore, an essential consideration for risk assessment in these regions. To illustrate and assess the effect of interflow on estimates of risk, we (1) developed a simple conceptual model to describe the role that interflow may have in the redistribution of surface and near-surface contamination, and (2) used RESRAD, an exposure model for assessing radionuclide doses to humans, to evaluate the effectiveness of landfill covers in mitigating doses of three contaminants (3H, 238U, and 239/240pu) at a site in northern New Mexico at which interflow is known to be occurring. Only those calculations of the model that took interflow into account yielded the result that the radionuclides would contaminate groundwater - underscoring the potential importance of interflow as a mechanism for the transport of contaminants. We conclude that failure to take interflow into account can render risk assessments inaccurate and remediation ineffective. Further, our work demonstrates that a general understanding of hydrological processes is essential for accurate risk assessment, ecological as well as human. © 1997 by ASP.},

The soil in this land was characterized by a negative net neutralization potential, and the soil pH was in a slightly acidic pH range (from 4 to 5). The contaminants were located mainly in the upper soil layers (mainly in the horizon A). Both methods were connected with the initial solubilization of the contaminants. Water acidified with sulphuric acid was used as a leach solution. The solubilization was mainly a result of the activity of the indigenous soil microflora. This activity was enhanced by suitable changes in the levels of some essential environmental factors, such as water, oxygen and nutrient content of the soil. The first method was then connected with the removal of the dissolved contaminants from the soil through the soil effluents. The second method was based on the transfer of the contaminants into the deeply located soil horizon B2, where they were immobilized mainly as a result of the activity of the indigenous sulphate-reducing bacteria. Their activity was enhanced by injecting water solutions of organic compounds into the horizon B2 through boreholes located in the relevant experimental plot. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Batch and dynamic leaching methods were used to evaluate the effectiveness of hydroxyapatite (HA), illite, and zeolite, alone and in combination, as soil additives for reducing the migration of cesium-137 (137Cs+) and uranium (U) from contaminated sediments. Amendment treatments ranging from 0 to 50 g kg-1 were added to the sediment and equilibrated in 0.001 M CaCl2. After equilibration, the treatment supernatants were analyzed for 137Cs+, U, PO4, and other metals. The residual sediments were then extracted overnight using one of the following: 1.0 M NH4Cl, 0.5 M CaCl2, or the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) extractant. Cesium was strongly sorbed to the contaminated sediments, presumably due to interlayer fixation within native illitic clays. In fact, 137Cs+ was below detection limits in the initial equilibration solutions, the CaCl2 extract, and the TCLP solution, regardless of amendment. Extractants selective for interlayer cations (1.0 M NH4Cl) were necessary to extract measurable levels of 137Cs+. Addition of illitic clays further reduced Cs+ extractability, even when subjected to the aggressive extractants. Zeolite, however, was ineffective in reducing Cs+ mobility when subjected to the aggressive extractants. Hydroxyapatite was less effective than illite at reducing NH4+-extractable Cs+. Hydroxyapatite, and mixtures of HA with illite or zeolite, were highly effective in reducing U extractability in both batch and leaching tests. Uranium immobilization by HA was rapid with similar final U concentrations observed for equilibration times ranging from 1 h to 30 d. The current results demonstrate the effectiveness of soil amendments in reducing the mobility of U and Cs+, which makes in-place immobilization an effective remediation alternative.},

	abstract = {The selection of plant species and amendments for the phytoremediation of uranium (U) contaminated soil has been hampered by a lack of information relating the speciation of U in the soil to plant uptake. The goals of the present study were to: 1) provide fundamental information regarding the uptake and translocation of U by plants; 2) utilize that information to improve the phytoextraction of U from contaminated soil. The first goal was achieved by using computer speciation modeling and hydroponic experiments to demonstrate that the uranyl (UO22+) cation was the U species most readily accumulated in plant shoots. A hydroponic screening experiment was then conducted to identify plants species capable of accumulating the uranyl cation in plant shoots. A soil incubation study addressed the second goal by examining the solubilization of U from contaminated soil by synthetic chelates (HEDTA) and organic acids (citric, oxalic). The results indicated that citric acid solubilized >100 times more U than the other amendments. The results of the hydroponic and soil experiments were then integrated in a pot study in which red beet was grown in U-contaminated soil amended with either citric acid or HEDTA. Citric acid was again highly effective, dramatically increasing shoot U content. In addition to providing fundamental information regarding the form of U taken up by plants, this study also illustrates the importance of basic research to the field of phytoremediation. Based on this information and other studies we have conducted, it should be possible to develop an effective phytoremediation strategy for U-contaminated soils, using citric acid as the principle soil amendment.},

	abstract = {Remediation of uranium-contaminated soils is considered a high priority by the U.S. Department of Energy because these soils, if left untreated, represent a hazard to the environment and human health. Because the risk to human health is a function of the solubility of uranium in the soils, the objectives of this work are to measure the uranium solubility of two contaminated soils, before and after remedial treatment, and determine the health risk associated with these soils. Two carbonate-rich, uranium- contaminated soils from the U.S. Department of Energy Fernald Environmental Management Project facility near Cincinnati, Ohio, as well as two nearby background soils were characterized and their uranium solubility measured in a 75-d solubility experiment using acid rain, groundwater, lung serum, and stomach acid simulants. Results show that the soluble uranium levels of each soil by each simulant are greatly influenced by their contamination source term. Risk calculations and biokinetic modeling based on the solubility data show that the risks from the soil ingestion and groundwater ingestion pathways are the predominant contributors to the total carcinogenic risk, whereas the risk from the soil inhalation pathway is the smallest contributor to this risk. However, kidney toxicity was the greater health concern of the Fernald Environmental Management Project soils, primarily from undiluted ingestion of the groundwater solution following contact with the contaminated soils. Sensitivity analyses indicate that uranium solubility is a key parameter in defining kidney toxicity; therefore, without proper consideration of the solubility of radionuclides/metals in untreated and treated soils, important factors may be overlooked which may result in soil cleanup goals or limits which are not protective of human health and the environment. We recommend that characterization and measurement of target radionuclides/metals solubilities should also be required by the regulatory community to support the establishment of scientifically-sound, site- specific, soil cleanup goals or limits.},

In the U.S., regulatory agencies and industry guidelines recommend that the remediation contractor conduct an external laboratory QC program to ensure the quality of the analytical results. The commercial availability of certified natural soil matrices is extremely limited not only by nuclide and nuclide concentration but also by soil type. In most cases, the applicability of these materials for an external QC program is questionable since the chemical constituents of the certified soil may not be representative of the remediation soil type. Also, such materials are typically only suitable as single blind performance evaluation (PE) samples. The Yankee Atomic Environmental Laboratory (YAEL) has characterized soil materials from several uranium mining and milling sites for use in two laboratory PE programs. The site specific PE materials were prepared in accordance with their intended use and quality performance requirements. One PE material was dried, pulverized to a particle size of approximately 10 microns and homogeneously blended. The second PE material (total of 1,024 kg) was methodically field blended and aliquoted to produce 1,000 separate homogeneous 1 kg samples. Both PE materials were characterized for radionuclide concentration and heterogeneity or sample distribution. A summary of the characterization studies of the different PE materials as well as the quality performance criteria developed for evaluating the laboratory's performance and the advantages and disadvantages of using each PE material will be discussed and summarized.},

Leach solutions of concentrated sulfuric acid and of carbonate (with and without oxidants such as peroxides) have also been used in the mining of U from high-grade ore deposits. Many of these solutions have been used at U-contaminated environmental sites with varying degrees of success. Batch leaches with six characterized U-contaminated media and seven leach solutions were conducted. After the leach solutions were reacted with the media (five soils and a catch-box sand), the solutions were analyzed for dissolved U, Ca, Si, Fe, Mn, Pb and Cr. We study the ability of acidic, basic, acidic-oxidizing and basic-oxidizing solutions to leach U from contaminated media. The results suggest the removal efficiency of soil U for each leach solution varies with the nature of the U-contamination in the media and the media composition. It is likely the forms of U in the contaminated media such as reduced, absorbed, complexed and solid species influence the solubilization of U by the leaching agents.},

Often, a lack of basic information on the chemical and physical characteristics of the soil and contaminants hampers treatability studies used to design these technologies. This article proposes and demonstrates a characterization program to meet these information needs, employing standard analytical techniques coupled with advanced spectroscopy and microscopy techniques. To support treatments involving physical separation strategies, the program uses standard analytical techniques to characterize the soil and the association of contaminants with different soil fractions (e.g., size and density fractions). Where chemical treatments are required, spectroscopy and microscopy methods are employed to yield quantitative information on the oxidation state and speciation of the contaminant. Examples demonstrate the use of measured soil and contaminant characteristics in the screening of alternative treatment technologies and in the selection of soils for use in treatability studies. Also demonstrated is the use of these characterization tools in the design and optimization of treatment strategies and in support of risk assessment determinations. © 1996 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company.},

	abstract = {As one consequence of economic growth over the past several decades, the citizens of the United States have inherited an unfortunate legacy of contaminated soil and groundwater. Both the private and public sectors have contributed. From the private sector, has come the waste stream of the industrial revolution. A ubiquitous example is the corner gasoline station: we now acknowledge gasoline leaks from many of these underground storage tanks in the country. A major contribution from the public sector comes from the military establishment. Probably the most serious example here is 'mixed waste' resulting from nuclear weapon production: a mixture of toxic and radioactive wastes such as a hydrocarbon based solvent and uranium which contaminates soil at many government sites. The clean-up has begun but the early optimism has faded to the reality of a two-fold concern: the cost will be enormous using present techniques and, just as disturbing, some of the problems have no known solutions. Clearly, new approaches are needed. In response, the US Government is supporting development of new technology and transfer of existing technology from other disciplines to apply to the problem. Part of this effort is the development of geophysical tools used for underground imaging. These tools are closely related to many of those used in industrial process tomography. Examples of both seismic and electromagnetic process tomography are discussed in relation to environmental remediation of soils and groundwaters in the United States. © 1995.},

	abstract = {We studied soil and ground water samples from the tailings disposal site near Tuba City, AZ, located on Navajo sandstone, in terms of uranium adsorption and precipitation. The uranium concentration is up to 1 mg/l, 20 times the maximum concentration for ground water protection in the United States. The concentration of bicarbonate (HCO3-) in the ground water increased from ≤7x10-4 M, the background concentration, to 7x10-3 M. Negatively charged uranium carbonate complexes prevail at high carbonate concentrations and uranium is not adsorbed on the negatively charged mineral surfaces. Leaching experiments using contaminated and uncontaminated sandstone and 1 N HCl show that adsorption of uranium from the ground water is negligible. Batch adsorption experiments with the sandstone and ground water at 16°C, the in situ ground water temperature, show that uranium is not adsorbed, in agreement with the results of the leaching experiments. Adsorption of uranium at 16°C is observed when the contaminated ground water is diluted with carbonate-free water. The observed increase in pH from 6.7 to 7.3 after dilution is too small to affect adsorption of uranium on the sandstone. Storage of undiluted ground water to 24°C, the temperature in the laboratory, causes coprecipitation of uranium with aragonite and calcite. Our study provides knowledge of the on-site uranium chemistry that can be used to select the optimum ground water remediation strategy. We discuss our results in terms of ground water remediation strategies such as pump and treat, in situ bioremediation, steam injection, and natural flushing.

The leaching characteristics of the expected waste materials indicates that uranium concentrations in the leachate could exceed 30 mg/L. Addition of a geochemical barrier to the disposal cell design, or the application of chemical amendments to the waste materials, have been suggested as methods to reduce uranium levels in leachate leaving the disposal cell. Three promising approaches were identified: a) stabilization of mobile uranium by sulfate-reducing bacteria; b) stabilization of uranium as low solubility oxides by hydrated lime addition; and c) sorption of mobile uranium by a peat moss-based geochemical barrier in the disposal cell. Bench scale tests were conducted to evaluate the relative effectiveness of these three approaches. The results suggest that: a) a peat moss-based barrier would be effective in removing uranium initially, but long-term exposure to an alkaline leachate would result in the resolubilization and transport of uranium previously sorbed onto the peat moss; b) even large applications of hydrated lime to uranium-contaminated soils would not stabilize uranium in a high alkalinity, high pH environment; and c) mixed cultures of sulfate-reducing bacteria will greatly attenuate uranium levels (even in alkaline solutions) by precipitating it in the reduced form as UO2. Consequently, a geochemical barrier containing sulfate-reducing bacteria should be more effective than one using peat moss or hydrated lime.},

Uranium fractions of contaminated soils [(exchangeable, carbonate, manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), organic, and residual)] were determined periodically over an 8-week incubation period. Uranium accumulated mainly in the roots of plant species. The highest concentration of U was 102 mg U kg-1 in plant shoots and 6200 mg U kg-1 in plant roots. Plant performance was affected by U contamination rates, especially in calcareous soils. Plants grown in soils with high carbonate-U fractions accumulated the most U in shoots and roots. The lowest plant U occurred in clayey acid soils with high Fe, Mn and organic U-fractions. The effectiveness of U remediation of soils by plants was strongly influenced by soil type.

Long-lived Pu isotopes provide an alternative tracer to the more widely used 137Cs (t1/2=30 a), the concentration of which is decaying at a rate that will limit its long-term application to these studies. For 239,240Pu, the sensitivity of AMS is more than an order of magnitude better than that afforded by α-spectroscopy. Furthermore, AMS can provide a simple, direct measure of the 240Pu/239Pu ratio. Sample profiles from two sites along eastern Australia have been determined with both AMS and α-spectroscopy to provide comparative measurements of the sediment accumulation rate in water bodies and of the soil erosion rate. The two methods are in good agreement. The 228Ra/226Ra ratio potentially provides a probe for tracing the dispersion of uranium mining residues into the neighboring environment. Soil depth profiles of the ratio may provide information on the rate at which mining-derived radioactivity is spread by surface waters, and could be used to assess the effectiveness of remediation and rehabilitation technologies. AMS offers several advantages over the more usual α- and γ-spectroscopy techniques in that it can directly and quickly measure both isotopes in a sample of small size and with simple sample preparation. We show that AMS can be used to measure these isotopes of radium at the sensitivity required for environmental samples using RaC2 - as the injected beam species. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Microbiological reduction of soluble U(VI) to insoluble U(IV) has been proposed as a remediation strategy for uranium-contaminated groundwater. Nitrate is a common co-contaminant with uranium. Nitrate inhibited U(VI) reduction in acetate-amended aquifer sediments collected from a uranium-contaminated site in New Mexico. Once nitrate was depleted, both U(VI) and Fe(III) were reduced concurrently. When nitrate was added to sediments in which U(VI) had been reduced, U(VI) reappeared in solution. Parallel studies with the dissimilatory Fe(III)-, U(VI)- and nitrate-reducing microorganism, Geobacter metallireducens, demonstrated that nitrate inhibited reduction of Fe(III) and U(VI) in cell suspensions of cells that had been grown with nitrate as the electron acceptor, but not in Fe(III)-grown cells. Suspensions of nitrate-grown G. metallireducens oxidized Fe(II) and U(IV) with nitrate as the electron acceptor. U(IV) oxidation was accelerated when Fe(II) was also added, presumably due to the Fe(III) being formed abiotically oxidizing U(IV). These studies demonstrate that although the presence of nitrate is not likely to be an impediment to the bioremediation of uranium contamination with microbial U(VI) reduction, it is necessary to reduce nitrate before U(VI) can be reduced. These results also suggest that anaerobic oxidation of U(IV) to U(VI) with nitrate serving as the electron acceptor may provide a novel strategy for solubilizing and extracting microbial U(IV) precipitates from the subsurface.},

The technology is especially suited to sites with high TCE concentrations. It relies upon electricity, utilizing buried electrodes to apply an electric current to the soil. The areas of the plant once served as test sites for determining the effects of extreme temperatures on cylinders containing depleted uranium. TCE was used to help chill the cylinders during such safety tests, thus, some parts of the site contain high concentrations of the contaminant.

	abstract = {Germinable seed in the soil seed bank and vegetation were characterized at a former uranium mill site in the Great Basin desert, Arizona, 10 years after a remediation program was conducted to remove surface contamination and revegetate the site. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of reseeding as routinely practiced to revegetate such sites. Three different conditions at the site were evaluated: (1) an area that had been bladed to remove topsoil then reseeded with exotic and native species and fenced to exclude livestock (ungrazed - bladed - reseeded) (2)a control area inside the fence that had not been bladed or reseeded (ungrazed), and (3) for further comparison, an area outside the fence that was undisturbed by the milling and remediation efforts but has received normal grazing pressure (grazed). Each condition was represented by three plots, from which soil samples and transect data were collected. The diversity of species and total number of viable seeds in the seed bank (top 5 cm of soil) were lowest in the ungrazed - bladed - reseeded plots (P < 0.05). These plots also had lower plant cover (15%) than the ungrazed plots (24%) (P < 0.05), comparable to the cover on grazed plots (11%), even after 10 years of grazing exclusion. We conclude that at this site the results of topsoil removal and replacement were not effectively remediated by reseeding. Although these methods may be effective in moister climates, more intensive efforts to reintroduce vegetation may be required in desert sites such as this. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Uranium (U) was successfully removed from contaminated soils from the Fernald Environmental Management Project (FEMP) site near Fernald, Ohio. The laboratory column leach process, referred to as the simulated heap leach process, using 0.5 M sodium bicarbonate as the dominant reagent, was able to achieve uranium removals of 75-90%, corresponding approximately to the percentage of uranium in the oxidized state. Parametric optimization studies are reported. The dissolution of uranium took place in two stages: a rapid desorption associated with soil surfaces and a slow step associated with diffusion of uranium toward solid surfaces. In addition, use of the oxidizing agent, sodium peroxide, improved uranium removal due to oxidation of U(IV), enhancing the solubility of the uranium. The results suggest that the process will be effective for field scale remediation of uranium-contaminated soils because of the efficiency, mild complexing agent employed, lack of pre- screening of the soil and the simple equipment necessary. Two relevant companion studies have recently been completed. The first, a scale-up demonstration [Turney, W. R. J. R., Mason, C.-F. V.; Lu, N.; Duff, M. C.; Dry, D. Pilot Treatment Project for the Remediation of Uranium-Contaminated Soft at a Former Nuclear Weapons Development Site at the LANL; Waste Management '97 Tucson, 1997], using ales Alamos site, confirms the approach to be effective up to 1 ton of sell and the second, a cost study, suggests this method is economically competitive for large soil volumes (> 1000 cu yd) when combined with a radionuclide presort [Cummings, M., Booth, S.

Results indicate that although SO42- carries divalent negative charges, it showed the least selectivity for sorption by the Purolite A-520E resin, which is functionalized with triethylamine exchange sites. Nitrate was the most strongly sorbed. Sorption selectivity followed the order of NO3- > Cl- > SO4 2- under the experimental conditions. Nitrate competitively sorbed and displaced previously sorbed SO42- in a column flow-through experiment and resulted in a high elution front of SO 42- in the effluent. Although the concentration of uranium in groundwater is orders of magnitude lower than that of NO 3- or SO42-, it was found to be strongly sorbed by the anion-exchange resin. Because the most stable uranium species in oxic and suboxic environments is the UO22+ cation, its strong sorption by anion-exchange resins is hypothesized to be the result of the co-ion effect of NO3- by forming anionic UO2(NO3)3- complexes in the resin matrix. These observations point out a potential alternative remediation strategy that uses strong-base anion-exchange resins to remove uranium from this site-specific groundwater, which has a low pH and a relatively high NO 3- concentration.},

	abstract = {Batch equilibrations were performed to investigate the ability of hydroxyapatite (Ca5(PO4)3OH) to chemically immobilize U in two contaminated sediment samples having different organic carbon contents (123 and 49 g kg-1, respectively). Apatite additions lowered aqueous U to near proposed drinking water standards in batch equilibrations of two distinct sediment strata having total U concentrations of 1703 and 2100 mg kg-1, respectively. Apatite addition of 50 g kg-1 reduced the solubility of U to values less than would be expected if autunite (Ca(UO2)2(PO4)2·10H2O) was the controlling solid phase. A comparison of the two sediment types suggests that aqueous phase U may be controlled by both the DOC content through complexation and the equilibrium pH for a given apatite application rate. Sequential chemical extractions demonstrated that apatite amendment transfers U from more chemically labile fractions, including water-soluble, exchangeable, and acid-soluble (pH ≃ 2.55) fractions, to the Mn-occluded fraction (pH ≃ 1.26). This suggests that apatite amendment redirects solid- phase speciation with secondary U phosphates being solubilized due to the lower pH of the Mn-occluded extractant, despite the lack of significant quantities of Mn oxides within these sediments. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis conducted in a transmission electron microscope (TEM) confirmed that apatite amendment sequesters some U in secondary Al/Fe phosphate phases.},

Our study compared selected soil properties from areas on in situ uranium wellfields managed by the two strategies stated above and with adjacent, relatively undisturbed sites. Vegetation reestablishment was assessed on sites where topsoil was left in place. Results indicated that levels of vehicular traffic on wellfields did not cause significant soil compaction and that removal and stock-piling of topsoil results in more negative impacts than disturbance inflicted when topsoil is left in place.},

Uraninite precipitated together with mackinawite (FeS0.9) because Fe(III) from the sandstone and sulfate, another contaminant in the water were reduced together with U(VI). After completion of U(VI) reduction, experiments were conducted to find out whether uraninite is protected by mackinawite against reoxidation. Uncontaminated ground water from the same site, containing 7 mg/l of dissolved oxygen, was passed through the columns or mixed with sandstone in batch experiments. The results showed that small masses of uraninite, 0.1 μg/g of sandstone, are protected by mackinawite from reoxidation. Uraninite masses on the order of 0.1 μg/g correspond to U(VI) concentrations of 0.5 mg/l, typically encountered in uranium contaminated ground waters. Mackinawite is an effective buffer and is formed in sufficient quantity to provide long-term protection of uraninite. Uranium concentrations in ground water passed through the columns are too low (4 μg/l) to distinguish between dissolution and oxidative dissolution of uraninite. However, batch experiments showed that uraninite oxidation takes place. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {The speciation of U(VI) sorbed to synthetic hydroxyapatite was investigated using a combination of U LIII-edge XAS, synchrotron XRD, batch uptake measurements, and SEM-EDS. The mechanisms of U(VI) removal by apatite were determined in order to evaluate the feasibility of apatitebased in-situ permeable reactive barriers (PRBs). In batch U(VI) uptake experiments with synthetic hydroxyapatite (HA), near complete removal of dissolved uranium (>99.5%) to <0.05 μM was observed over a range of total U(VI) concentrations up to equimolar of the total P in the suspension. XRD and XAS analyses of U(VI)-reacted HA at sorbed concentrations ≤4700 ppm U(VI) suggested that uranium(VI) phosphate, hydroxide, and carbonate solids were not present at these concentrations. Fits to EXAFS spectra indicate the presence of Ca neighbors at 3.81 Å. U-Ca separation, suggesting that U(VI) adsorbs to the HA surfaces as an inner-sphere complex. Uranium(VI) phosphate solid phases were not detected in HA with 4700 ppm sorbed U(VI) by backscatter SEM or EDS, in agreement with the surface complexation process. In contrast, U(VI) speciation in samples that exceeded 7000 ppm sorbed U(VI) included a crystalline uranium(VI) phosphate solid phase, identified as chernikovite by XRD. At these higher concentrations, a secondary, uranium(VI) phosphate solid was detected by SEM-EDS, consistent with chernikovite precipitation. Autunite formation occurred at total U:P molar ratios ≥0.2. Our findings provide a basis for evaluating U(VI) sorption mechanisms by commercially available natural apatites for use in development of PRBs for groundwater U(VI) remediation.},

	abstract = {The importance of biodiversity (below and above ground) is increasingly considered for the cleanup of the metal contaminated and polluted ecosystems. This subject is emerging as a cutting edge area of research gaining commercial significance in the contemporary field of environmental biotechnology. Several microbes, including mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal fungi, agricultural and vegetable crops, ornamentals, and wild metal hyperaccumulating plants are being tested both in lab and field conditions for decontaminating the metalliferous substrates in the environment. As on todate about 400 plants that hyperaccumulate metals are reported. The families dominating these members are Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Cyperaceae, Cunouniaceae, Fabaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Lamiaceae, Poaceae, Violaceae, and Euphobiaceae. Brassicaceae had the largest number of taxa viz. 11 genera and 87 species. Different genera of Brassicaceae are known to accumulate metals. Ni hyperaccumulation is reported in 7 genera and 72 species and Zn in 3 genera and 20 species. Thlaspi species are known to hyperaccumulate more than one metal i.e. T. caerulescence = Cd, Ni. Pb, and Zn; T. goesingense = Ni and Zn and T. ochroleucum = Ni and Zn and T. rotundifolium = Ni, Pb and Zn. Plants that hyperaccumulate metals have tremendous potential for application in remediation of metals in the environment. Significant progress in phytoremediation has been made with metals and radionuclides. This process involves rising of plants hydroponically and transplanting them into metal-polluted waters where plants absorb and concentrate the metals in their roots and shoots. As they become saturated with the metal contaminants, roots or whole plants are harvested for disposal. Most researchers believe that plants for phytoremediation should accumulate metals only in the roots. Several aquatic species have the ability to remove heavy metals from water, viz., water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms); pennywort (Hydrocotyle umbellata L.) and duckweed (Lemna minor L.). The roots of Indian mustard are effective in the removal of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn and sunflower removes Pb, U, 137Cs, and 90Sr from hydroponic solutions. Aquatic plants in freshwater, marine and estuarine systems act as receptacle for several metals. Hyperaccumulators accumulate appreciable quantities of metal in their tissue regardless of the concentration of metal in the soil, as long as the metal in question is present. The phytoextraction process involves the use of plants to facilitate the removal of metal contaminants from a soil matrix. In practice, metal-accumulating plants are seeded or transplanted into metal-polluted soil and are cultivated using established agricultural practices. If metal availability in the soil is not adequate for sufficient plant uptake, chelates or acidifying agents would be applied to liberate them into the soil solution. Use of soil amendments such as synthetics (ammonium thiocyanate) and natural zeolites have yielded promising results. Synthetic cross-linked polyacrylates, hydrogels have protected plant roots from heavy metals toxicity and prevented the entry of toxic metals into roots. After sufficient plant growth and metal accumulation, the above-ground portions of the plant are harvested and removed, resulting the permanent removal of metals from the site. Soil metals should also be bioavailable, or subject to absorption by plant roots. Chemicals that are suggested for this purpose include various acidifying agents, fertilizer salts and chelating materials. The retention of metals to soil organic matter is also weaker at low pH, resulting in more available metal in the soil solution for root absorption. It is suggested that the phytoextraction process is enhanced when metal availability to plant roots is facilitated through the addition of acidifying agents to the soil. Chelates are used to enhance the phytoextraction of a number of metal contaminants including Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn Researchers initially applied hyperaccumulators to clean metal polluted soils. Several researchers have screened fast-growing, high-biomass-accumulating plants, including agronomic crops, for their ability to tolerate and accumulate metals in their shoots. Genes responsible for metal hyperaccumulation in plant tissues have been identified and cloned. Glutathione and organic acids metabolism plays a key role in metal tolerance in plants. Glutathione is ubiquitous component cells from bacteria to plants and animals. In phytoremediation of metals in the environment, organic acids play a major role in metal tolerance. Organic acids acids form complexes with metals, a process of metal detoxification. Genetic strategies and transgenic plant and microbe production and field trials will fetch phytoremediaition field applications. The importance of biodiversity and biotechnology to remediate potentially toxic metals are discussed in this paper. Brassicaceae amenable to biotechnological improvement and phytoremediation hype are highlighted.},

	abstract = {Sequential extractions of contaminants from a soil or sediment have been shown to be cost-effective contaminated site assessment tools that provide information on contaminant partitioning within an environmental matrix. Such information is necessary for defining remediation alternatives and mitigation strategies. The typical sequential extraction approach involves a batch method, and known limitations include the possibility of contaminant readsorption to the remaining soil or sediment. In this work, a flow-through reactor was constructed and tested for application in a sequential extraction scheme. The sequential extraction scheme used was one developed for actinide-contaminated materials. The flow-through approach gave partitioning results that were similar to the batch method for uranium. We also monitored the extraction of stable Ca, K, Fe, Al, Zr, and Sc and obtained partitioning results generally similar to those observed with the batch extraction, except for Ca. Our results indicate readsorption of Ca when using a batch approach is small but significant and is eliminated with our new flow-through method. A limitation of the flow-through method is the possibility of underextraction of certain phases and higher analytical uncertainties. These uncertainties are more difficult to minimize, as compared to the uncertainty obtained with a batch approach.},

	abstract = {Until recently, nonenzymatic processes were generally considered to account for much of the Fe(III) reduction in subsurface environments. However, it is now clear that enzymatic Fe(III) reduction catalyzed by microorganisms which conserve energy to support growth by completely oxidizing organic compounds to carbon dioxide accounts for most of the Fe(III) reduction. Microbial Fe(III) reduction in deep pristine aquifers releases dissolved inorganic carbon into groundwater which may increase aquifer porosity. The Fe(III) released into the groundwater is an important groundwater quality problem in many aquifers. Microbial oxidation of organic contaminants coupled to Fe(III) reduction removes significant amounts of pollutants from many contaminated aquifers. Fe(III) reduction and hence contaminant removal can be accelerated in aquifer sediments with the addition of Fe(III) chelators or humic substances. Both of these amendments alleviate the need for Fe(III) reducers to come into direct physical contact with Fe(III) oxides in order to reduce them. Some Fe(III)-reducing microorganisms can reduce contaminant metals and metalloids such as uranium, technetium, cobalt, chromium and selenium. This metabolism may be useful for remediation of metal-contaminated subsurface environments. Fe(III) reducers and some of the insoluble Fe(II) products of Fe(III) reduction can reducively dechlorinated chlorinated contaminants. Magnetite that is similar to that produced by known Fe(III)-reducing microorganisms has been recovered at depths as great as 6.7 km on earth and has been observed in a Martian meteorite. Thus, microbial oxidation of organic matter coupled to the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) appears to be a important process in a variety of subsurface environments.},

	abstract = {The lower portion of Tims Branch (TB), a second-order stream system on the Savannah River site (SC, USA), receives influx of mixed waste-contaminated sediments from Steed Pond, a former settling basin for target processing wastes for over three decades. The magnitude and distribution of U, Ni, and other metals and the potential for trophic movement were studied to facilitate risk assessment and determine potential remedial action. Total and sequential extraction of TB soils demonstrated contaminant heterogeneity both spatially and between operationally defined fractions. Metal concentrations were elevated within riparian zone soils in contrast to stream sediments, suggesting off-site transport. Leaf tissue from TB contained an order of magnitude more Ni than tissue from reference sites. Leaves from streamside trees contained no U but elevated Ni up to 75.4 (±25) mg/kg dry weight (dry wt). Understory flora (Discanthelium sp. and Andropogon sp.) contained high concentrations of U associated with leaves up to 518 (±7.5) mg/kg dry weight U. The contrast in contaminant content and ratio of streamside and understory vegetation may result from resuspension of particulate U and Ni onto leaf surfaces and represents a potential pathway for trophic movement. The findings of this study have important ramifications for remediation of the ecosystem, suggesting that a strategy based on contaminant immobilization may be the most appropriate.},

The changes in soils' remaining contamination were evaluated for the period of 15 years of the recultivated site exploitation in agriculture. The study showed that forecast of soils' self-cleaning that was performed in 1975 after remediation of the site was not realistic. The content of natural radionuclides in upper layer of the soil does not changed practically. The analysis of the state of a ground water showed that the halo of residual solutions with high content of sulphate and nitrate ions is distributed 1,7 km down the flow of ground waters and 0,35 km up the flow. Intensity of the underground water self-cleaning is very insignificant.},

	abstract = {Integrated radon measurements, including gamma radiation measurements, radon flux and radon grab measurements were carried out at a remediated radioactive waste disposal site. Although the 1990 remediation of the site resulted in an 85 to 100% reduction in incremental radon concentrations, the measurements identified a localized area adjacent to the original remedial work area to be another radiation. Further remediation had to be carried out at this source in late 1994 and recent data indicate that atmospheric radon concentrations are now within the background range.; Historic low-level radioactive wastes date back to 1933 in Canada, when a radium refinery began operation in Port Hope, Ontario. Residual wastes and contaminated soils resulting from the waste management practices carried out in the early years of radium and uranium production were discovered in the mid-1970s. The lack of a permanent disposal site for low-level radioactive wastes limited a large-scale cleanup to include developed properties only. As a result, substantial quantities of contaminated soils remained in a number of large undeveloped areas, pending the availability of a permanent site. Radon emanation from radium contaminated soils located at, or near, the ground surface is a potential route for radiation exposure to neighbouring residents. Atmospheric radon concentrations have been monitored in Port Hope since 1985, and radon concentrations above the range of local background concentrations have been measured adjacent to the historic waste site described in this paper. Interim remedial work completed at this site in 1990 resulted in an 85 to 100% reduction in incremental radon concentrations at the boundaries of neighbouring properties. A follow-up program to identify any remaining source(s) of elevated outdoor radon was initiated. Integrated radon measurements, as well as gamma radiation measurements, radon flux and radon grab sample measurements at this site, identified a localized area adjacent to the original remedial work area as the source. Further remedial work was carried out in late 1994 to eliminate the source of elevated radon which remained at this site. Recent data indicate that atmospheric radon concentrations are now within the background range. This remedial work project illustrates both the role of environmental radon monitoring in assessing the need for interim work, and its usefulness in providing quantifiable measures of effectiveness. Technical issues associated with the measurements and the analyses of the data are also discussed.},

	abstract = {A quantitative cost-risk decision framework using geostatistical simulation to quantify uncertainty related to less-than-exhaustive site characterization can be used to identify cost-effective plans for environmental remediation. This framework has been applied to the problem of selecting among alternative technologies for measuring the uranium activity of in-situ soil adjacent to an aerosol contamination source at the U.S. Department of Energy Fernald (Ohio USA) site. The decision framework involves minimizing the total expected cost of site characterization, site treatment, and potential regulatory failure to clean the site to established standards across a reasonable number of engineering alternatives. The preferred alternative technology has been shown to be a function of the regulatory action level and the degree of risk-aversion of the decision maker. The lowest total-cost alternative may not be associated with the lowest probability of making incorrect treat vs. leave-in-place decisions for individual remediation units. Characterization, treatment, and potential failure costs vary spatially and maps of these likely costs can provide useful information with respect to staged sampling efforts and stopping criteria for site characterization work.},

	abstract = {Development of the nuclear industry has resulted in soil becoming contaminated with uranium from a variety of sources. To avoid the disposal of these soils in conventional low-level radwaste burial sites, a technology is needed to extract/leach and concentrate uranium in soil into small volumes of an acceptable waste form and returning the soil to its original place. Two lixiviants, carbonate and citrate, were evaluated as to their ability to extract uranium from soil in a soil washing engineering process. The objective was to use a washing/extracting process to selectively remove the uranium from soil without seriously degrading the soil's physicochemical characteristics or generating a secondary waste form that is difficult to manage and/or dispose. Both carbonate and citric acid lixiviants were observed to be effective extractants to remove uranium from the soils tested. Carbonate, because of the its ability to be recycled and its tendency to be more selective for uranium, is preferred for most soils. A major obstacle for using citric acid as well as mineral-based acids is their generation of waste streams from which it is difficult to remove uranium and manage (and dispose of any residual waste water sludges) in an environmentally acceptable manner. The removal of uranium was examined for three soils sampled from two US Department of Energy sites. Two soils were from the facility formerly called the Feed Materials Production Center at Fernald, Ohio and the other soil was from the Oak Ridge Tennessee Y-12 Plant. In the bench-scale studies, general relationships, such as the effect of carbonate and citrate concentrations, pH, the presence of oxidants, such as KMnO4, temperature, and extraction time were investigated. The best pilot-scale treatment consisted of three successive extractions with 0.25 M carbonate-bicarbonate (in presence of KMnO4 as an oxidant) at 40°C followed with two water rinses.

Adsorption of uranium(VI) is strongly influenced by groundwater chemistry, especially pH and total dissolved carbonate concentration. To evaluate the effectiveness of adsorption onto amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide as a containment barrier, the extent of uranium adsorption was quantified as a function of solution chemistry and other adsorption parameters. The adsorption model was used within a coupled hydrogeochemical transport model to evaluate the conditions under which amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide can be effective in preventing groundwater contamination. The modeling results depicted spatial and temporal evolution of the tailings-groundwater system, and permitted delineation of the uranium(VI) plume in groundwater under different scenarios. The analysis showed that adsorption of uranium(VI) onto amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide can be an effective mechanism for preventing release of uranium(VI) into groundwater especially for neutral-pH mill tailings. It was also found that essentially no retardation occurred in tailings with alkaline pore fluids. An economic analysis showed that the amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide treatment can be applied to neutral-pH mill tailings in a cost-effective manner. The results obtained in the study support the conceptual foundation of geochemical engineering in waste management. © 1995.},

	abstract = {Electrokinetic soil remediation is one of the most promising soil decontamination processes because it has high removal efficiency and time effectiveness in low permeability soils, such as clay. Uranium and strontium were efficiently removed from kaolinite by electrokinetic remediation. In the case of cesium, the rate of removal may be significantly slower than those of the uranium and strontium. Acetic acid was effective as enhancement agent for buffering hydroxide ions produced by the cathode reaction, resulting in the prevention of the precipitation of uranium ions in the cathode region. This also decreased energy consumption because hydroxide precipitation increased the resistance and the electrical gradient across the soil cell. The use of citric acid was not efficient in removing uranium from kaolinite because the direction of electromigration was opposite to that of electroosmosis. Since most metal-citrate chelates are negatively charged, they were transported towards the anode by electromigration, whereas electroosmosis flowed toward the cathode, resulting in lowering removal efficiency. Uranium was not effectively removed from the weathered soil of black shale by electrokinetic remediation process. This may be due to the low proportion of the mobile ions because most of uranium exists in the residual fraction.},

Strain FRCl was capable of using O2, NO3-, S 2O32-, fumarate, and malate as terminal electron acceptors and of reducing U(VI) in the cell suspension. Analysis of the 16S rDNA sequence of the isolate indicated that this strain was 96.4% similar to Salmonella bongori and 96.3% similar to Enterobacter cloacae.

	abstract = {Although direct microbial reduction of Cr(VI) and U(VI) is known, few studies have examined the kinetics and the underlying mechanisms of the reduction of these contaminants by different natural organic matter (NOM) fractions in the presence or absence of microorganisms. In this study, NOM was found to chemically reduce Cr(VI) at pH 3, but the reduction rates were negligible at pH ∼7. The abiotic reduction of U(VI) by NOM was not observed, possibly because of the presence of small amounts of nitrate in the reactant solution. However, all NOM fractions, particularly the soil humic acid (HA), enhanced the bioreduction of Cr(VI) or U(VI) in the presence of Shewanella putrefaciens CN32. The reduction rates varied greatly among NOM fractions with different chemical and structural properties: the polyphenolic-rich NOM-PP fraction appeared to be the most reactive in abiotically reducing Cr(VI) at a low pH, but soil HA was more effective in mediating the microbial reduction of Cr(VI) and U(VI) under anaerobic, circumneutral pH conditions. These observations are attributed to an increased solubility and conformational changes of the soil HA with pH and, more importantly, its relatively high contents of polycondensed and conjugated aromatic organic moieties. An important implication of this study is that, depending on chemical and structural properties, different NOM components may play different roles in enhancing the bioreduction of Cr(VI) and U(VI) by microorganisms. Polycondensed aromatic humic materials may be particularly useful in mediating the bioreduction and rapid immobilization of these contaminant metals in soil. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The potential to stimulate an indigenous microbial community to reduce a mixture of U(VI) and Tc(VII) in the presence of high (120 mM) initial NO 3- co-contamination was evaluated in a shallow unconfined aquifer using a series of single-well, push-pull tests. In the absence of added electron donor, NO3-, Tc(VII), and U(VI) reduction was not detectable. However, in the presence of added ethanol, glucose, or acetate to serve as electron donor, rapid NO3- utilization was observed. The accumulation of NO2-, the absence of detectable NH4+ accumulation, and the production of N 2O during in situ acetylene-block experiments suggest that NO 3- was being consumed via denitrification. Tc(VII) reduction occurred concurrently with NO3- reduction, but U(VI) reduction was not observed until two or more donor additions resulted in iron-reducing conditions, as detected by the production of Fe(II). Reoxidation/remobilization of U(IV) was also observed in tests conducted with high (∼120 mM) but not low (∼1 mM) initial NO3- concentrations and not during acetylene-block experiments conducted with high initial NO3-. These results suggest that NO 3--dependent microbial U(IV) oxidation may inhibit or reverse U(VI) reduction and decrease the stability of U(IV) in this environment. Changes in viable biomass, community composition, metabolic status, and respiratory state of organisms harvested from down-well microbial samplers deployed during these tests were consistent with the conclusions that electron donor additions resulted in microbial growth, the creation of anaerobic conditions, and an increase in activity of metal-reducing organisms (e.g., Geobacter). The results demonstrate that it is possible to stimulate the simultaneous bioreduction of U(VI) and Tc(VII) mixtures commonly found with NO3- co-contamination at radioactive waste sites.},

Further strain development was limited by the non-transformability of this environmental isolate.

Subsequently, HUO2PO4-laden cells removed Ni2+ from dilute aqueous flows via intercalation of Ni2+ into the HUO2PO4 lattice. Despite comparable acid phosphatase activity in all three strains, the E. coli DH5α (phoC) construct was superior to Citrobacter N14 in both uranyl and nickel accumulation, while the E. coli DH5α (phoN) construct was greatly inferior in both respects. Expression of phosphatase activity alone is not the only factor that permits efficient and prolonged metal phosphate accumulation, and the data highlight possible differences in the PhoN and PhoC phosphatases, which are otherwise considered to be related in many respects.},

	abstract = {The first remediation of an Environmental Restoration (ER) Project site at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) was successfully conducted in May and June 1994 at Technical Area II (TA-II) in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The removal action involved four Uranium Calibration Pits (UCPs) filled with radioactive or hazardous materials. The concrete culvert pits were used between 1978 and 1984 by the United States Department of Energy (US DOE) to test and calibrate borehole radiometric logging tools for uranium exploration. The UCPs were remediated as part of a voluntary corrective measure (VCM) to reduce investigation costs and accelerate regulatory cleanup schedules. The cost of the VCM to the ER Project was approximately $100,000. A cost savings of at least $180,000 was achieved by conducting the VCM instead of following the standard regulatory process. The removal action consisted of excavating and containerizing the pit contents and contaminated soil beneath the culverts, removing the four culverts, and backfilling the excavation. Each UCP removal had unique complexities. Sixty 208-L drums of solid radioactive waste and eight 208-L drums of liquid hazardous waste were generated during the VCM. Two of the concrete culverts will be disposed as radioactive waste and two as solid waste. Uranium-238 was detected in UCP-2 ore material at 746 pCi/g, and at 59 pCi/g in UCP-1 silica sand. UCP-4 was empty; sludge from UCP-3 contained 122 mg/L (ppm) chromium. This work was supported by the United States Department of Energy under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.},

	abstract = {Canada's Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Office (LLRWMO) continues to make significant progress toward the remediation of orphan sites contaminated with historic Low Level Radioactive (LLR) waste. Since its establishment in 1982, the LLRWMO, which is operated by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, has acted as the agent of the federal government in this area, taking policy and priority direction from the federal department of Natural Resources Canada. The LLRWMO has investigated and decontaminated structures and properties at many sites across the country. It has removed contaminated soil, debris and radioactive artifacts to interim storage or interim, in situ containment. It has worked with communities and regulatory agencies to develop locally acceptable waste management solutions for the short- and long-term. This paper provides an update on the progress of environmental remediation programs and projects of the LLRWMO made since the last reporting at the Sixth ICEM Conference in Singapore in 1997. Emphasis is placed upon the areas of sustained interim waste management and community problem solving in this period. In addition, comment is provided on the future of the program. On behalf of the federal government, the LLRWMO was appointed in 2000 July to act as the proponent for the Port Hope Area Initiative (PHAI), a ten-year $260 M undertaking that will see historic LLR wastes currently found in various community locations consolidated into safe, long-term management facilities, yielding environmental benefits for present and future generations. This activity is breaking new ground in the implementation of community recommended solutions and signals the way forward in Canada's historic waste program.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, the application of biotechnological principles in the processing of low-grade mineral materials, which are economically not amenable for metal production by the conventional technology, is gaining considerable industrial importance. This tendency is especially motivated by the fact that biotechnological processes are simple to operate, less capital and energy extensive than the conventional technologies. Furthermore, these processes are environment friendly since they do not result any air, soil or aquifer pollution. As a rule of thumb, for example, a pound of copper can be produced from mining wastes for about one-third to one-half of the costs of copper production by the conventional smelting process from high-grade sulfide concentrate. Currently, approximately 25% of the total copper produced in the United States is imputable to bacterial activity in heap, dump and in-situ leaching operations. In Canada, an important segment of the uranium production is achieved by bio-assisted leach technologies. Other industrial application of biotechnological processing is related to gold production from refractory pyrite and arsenopyrite materials. When submicron-size native gold particles are finely disseminated within the above refractory ore materials, then the conventional cyanidation technology becomes economically marginal for the gold production. However, if these materials are subjected to pre-oxidation by the bacteria, pores will be created in the mineral matrices and the follow-up cyanidation can successfully extract gold. This integrated biopre-oxidation and cyanidation process is industrially practiced in South Africa, Brazil and Australia. Further establishment of industrial plants are in progress in Ghana. diverse bioremediation processes are under development for the removal of trace concentrations of heavy metals and radionuclides from very large volumes of industrial effluents and contaminated soils. It is well known that the conventional physical and chemical technologies are economically handicapped for dealing with these situations.},

This 90,000 ft2 facility was used from the late 1950s until the early 1980s for the conversion of uranium hexafluoride to various fuel forms, including uranium dioxide powder and pellets. Both high-and low-enriched uranium as well as thorium were processed in the facility. Upon discontinuing fuel manufacturing operations, the chemical processing equipment was decontaminated, removed, packaged, and shipped to a licensed low-level radioactive waste (LLRW) burial site. As a result of plant operations, uranium contamination existed within the building and in the soils on the plant site. A detailed site characterization program was completed to establish the extent of contamination and to plan the subsequent soil remediation and building deconstruction efforts. This paper overviews the Apollo decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) project with emphasis on the key business and technical issues which established constraints for the project.},

In response to technical assessments and information presented to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission by the U.S. Department of Energy, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has recently resolved the dilemma by concluding that compliance with Environmental Protection Agency soil cleanup standards for cobbly soil at Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action Project sites would be adequately attained using bulk radionuclide concentrations, instead of requiring that the radionuclide concentration of the finer soil fraction passing a #4 mesh sieve met the standards. A Nuclear Regulatory Commission- approved procedure developed for cobbly soil remediation is outlined and discussed.

Tests reveal that the process efficiencies in partially saturated kaolinite samples (without contaminants) are high, since water supplied at the anode eventually flushed across the specimens and saturated the deposits. Consolidation settlements are expected in the vicinity of anodes in fine-grained soils, even when both electrodes allow ingess or egress of the water. Uranyl ion at l OCX) pCi/g could be effectively removed from kaolinite but the removal efficiency decreased close to the cathode due to the high pH in this region. A yellow uranium hydroxide precipitate was collected at the cathode. Thorium ion, even at 300 pCi/g, could not be efficiently removed throughout the cell because of its high adsorptive capacity, facile hydrolysis, and the precipitation of insoluble hydroxide. Methods are required to prevent hydroxide ion formation by the cathode reduction of water and thus enable extraction of these metal species in soluble forms. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
